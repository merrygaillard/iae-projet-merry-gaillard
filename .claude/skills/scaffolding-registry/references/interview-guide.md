# Scaffolding Interview Guide

Six phases (0–5), about 25 minutes total. Run them in order. Each phase has a timebox —
treat it as a budget, not a target to fill.

**Pacing rule:** If a phase overruns its box, write what you have, mark the
gap in the close-out summary, and move on — missing nodes are homework;
fictional nodes are never a fallback.

---

## Phase 0 — Home (2 min)

**First, detect — don't ask.** Can you create and edit files in the folder
the student has open? (A file the student would have to download does not count — that is print-and-save mode.)

- **Yes → write mode.** The registry goes at the root of that folder. It
  does not matter whether the folder is local, a synced cloud-drive folder,
  or a Git repository — the bundle is plain Markdown with relative links.
  Confirm in one sentence: "I'll create `registry/` inside `<folder name>` —
  OK?"
- **No → print-and-save mode.** Say once, up front: "I can't save files
  here, so for each file I'll print its full contents and exactly where to
  save it. Where will you keep them — a GitHub repository, a folder on your
  computer, or a synced cloud-drive folder? GitHub is the easiest if you
  already have an account." Then, on **every** file,
  restate the location and remind them to save it as plain `.md`. Never say
  "I've created" for a file you only printed.

**Follow-ups (both modes):**
- "Do you already have the empty registry skeleton — from the template
  repository or its Download ZIP?" If yes, do not reprint or recreate
  `SCHEMA.md`, `index.md`, `log.md`, or the typed `index.md` stubs.
- "Do you already have a `registry/` folder, or a `workflow.yaml` /
  `outputs/<name>-requirements.md` setup from an earlier version of this
  framework?" In print-and-save mode you cannot look — ask the student to
  paste a listing of their `outputs/` folder, or to say "nothing there".

**Example to show:** none — this phase is about the student's environment,
not the registry's content.

**What to write:** nothing yet. In write mode, create `registry/` +
`SCHEMA.md` + `index.md` + `log.md` + the six typed directories with stub
`index.md` files, unless they already exist. In print-and-save mode and no
skeleton yet, print those same files first, in that order. If the student
asks "where's the template repo?", the URL is
`https://github.com/jamesgray-ai/ai-registry-template` — it ships this same
skeleton plus a GitHub Action that publishes the dashboard, and is optional.

**Legacy-detection trigger:** In write mode: if `outputs/*/workflow.yaml` exists anywhere in
the workspace, or an `outputs/<name>-requirements.md` file exists with no
matching folder (flat layout), stop and offer the migration path from
`migrating-legacy-workspaces.md` before continuing the interview. A student
migrating does not repeat Phases 1–4 for businesses, lines of business,
functions, or processes the migration already covers. In print-and-save mode, rely on what the student told you in the follow-up above.

**Fast path:** if the student already has a full `registry/` bundle from a
prior scaffolding run, skip straight to gap-filling — re-run only the phases
that produced missing or incomplete nodes.

---

## Phase 1 — Business (3 min)

**Opening question:** "What's the name of the business or team this registry
is for, and what does it do in one sentence?"

**Follow-ups:**
- "Is it active, still incubating, or dormant right now?"
- "Is there a URL you'd like on the dashboard?"

**Example to show:** the Business node from `example-registry.md`
(`registry/businesses/brightwork-consulting.md`).

**What to write:** one `registry/businesses/<slug>.md` node — required
frontmatter plus `status` and optional `url`, one identity sentence in the
body, and an empty `# Lines of Business` list (Phase 2 fills it).

**Fast path:** one business per registry is the default — do not offer
multi-business setup unless the student volunteers that they run more than
one.

---

## Phase 2 — Lines of Business (4 min)

**Opening question:** "Does this business have distinct lines of business, or
is it really one thing end to end?"

**Follow-ups:**
- "If there's more than one, what order should they show up in — the order that matters most to you?"
- "Any of these dormant or just getting started?"

**Example to show:** the two LineOfBusiness nodes from `example-registry.md`
(`advisory.md` and `training.md`) — Advisory shows a populated
`# Processes` list, Training shows the allowed-empty
`_No processes captured yet._` form.

**What to write:** one `registry/lines-of-business/<slug>.md` node per line,
each with `status` and a prose sentence, plus an entry in the Business
node's curated `# Lines of Business` list in the order given.

**Fast path (solo consultant / single-line business):** write one default
LOB named after the business itself and move on — don't force an artificial
split.

---

## Phase 3 — Functions (3 min)

**Opening question:** "Who owns the work day to day? I'll suggest a starter
set and you can trim or rename it."

**Follow-ups:**
- "Any of these unstaffed right now — no single owner?"
- "Anything missing from this list for how you're actually organized?"

**Starter set (verbatim):** Marketing, Sales, Service Delivery, Operations,
Product, Customer Success, IT/Engineering.

**Example to show:** the Function node from `example-registry.md`
(`registry/functions/service-delivery.md`) — note the empty GENERATED
`# Owns` block written at creation time.

**What to write:** one `registry/functions/<slug>.md` node per function the
student keeps, `lead:` filled in or left blank (blank = unstaffed, an
insight not an error), and every node written **with** its empty GENERATED
`# Owns` marker block — the reference lints an error on a Function missing
that block ("compose can't fill what doesn't exist").

**Fast path:** offer the starter set as-is; most students accept it with one
or two renames rather than building from scratch.

---

## Phase 4 — Processes (8 min)

**Opening question:** "For each line of business, what are the two or three
processes where AI could help the most right now? Not everything you do —
just the highest-value candidates."

**Follow-ups:**
- "Who owns each of these — which function?"
- "Is there an existing guide or SOP for any of them?"

**Example to show:** the Process node from `example-registry.md`
(`registry/processes/client-delivery.md`).

**What to write:** one `registry/processes/<slug>.md` node per process, each
with a title, a description, required `owner:` (a function slug from Phase
3), optional `guide:`, and an entry added to its LOB's curated
`# Processes` list.

**Fast path:** two or three processes per LOB is enough for the lab —
remind the student that Analyze (Step 1 of the framework) grows this list
later; don't try to be exhaustive here.

---

## Phase 5 — Close (3 min)

**Opening question:** "Is there anything you already know about how this
business runs — a process quirk, a constraint, a lesson learned — that's
worth capturing as a note before we wrap up?"

**Follow-ups:**
- "Anything that surprised you or changed how you'd do this next time?"

**Example to show:** the Note node from `example-registry.md`
(`registry/notes/2026-08-status-report-timing.md`).

**What to write:**
- an optional `registry/notes/<slug>.md` node — only if a real insight
  surfaced during the interview, never a manufactured one
- a founding `registry/log.md` entry describing the scaffolding run
- directory `index.md` stubs for every typed directory
- `registry/workflows/index.md` containing only `# Workflows` and a blank
  line — the directory must have an index even when empty, and Analyze
  appends to it

Hand off to
`indexing-registry` for the first maintenance pass: lint, generate the Tier
1 `REGISTRY.md`, and offer the Tier 2 dashboard. The lab should end with
something visual on screen. In print-and-save mode there is no hand-off: print the `log.md` entry, every typed `index.md` you updated, and a complete `REGISTRY.md` composed per `indexing-registry`'s rules, each with its location, and say the set is complete.

**Fast path:** if no insight surfaced, skip the Note entirely — an absent
Note is not a gap to flag; a forced one is worse than none.
