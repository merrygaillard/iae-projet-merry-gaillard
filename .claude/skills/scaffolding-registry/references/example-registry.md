# Example Registry — Brightwork Consulting (FICTIONAL)

Worked examples for the scaffolding interview. **Never copy these nodes into
the user's registry** — show them as the shape to imitate, then write the
user's real business instead. The finished registry must contain no
Brightwork residue.

## Directory index: `registry/workflows/index.md`

Every typed directory gets one. Entries are bundle-root-relative leading-slash
links — never bare same-directory links like `[Client Status Reporting](client-status-reporting.md)`,
which the schema's link discriminator resolves repo-root-relative and lint
flags as broken.
