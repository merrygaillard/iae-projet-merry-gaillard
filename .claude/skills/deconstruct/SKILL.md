  This skill should be used when the user wants to deconstruct a workflow, break down a business
  process, capture requirements for an AI workflow, or define a goal for an agent system.
  Step 2 is the PRD for the workflow — it captures what the workflow must do, the rules it must
  follow, and the edge cases it must handle, in clear requirements language suitable for the
  Design step or any AI model to consume. Supports two paths: step-driven (you know how the
  work gets done) and goal-driven (you know what "done" looks like and want an agent system
  to determine the path). Produces a structured Workflow Requirements document.
  Also use when the user says "continue my workflow" and the Workflow node shows Step 2 (Deconstruct) is next.
  This is Step 2 of the AI Workflow Framework.

# Workflow Deconstruction

Step 2 is the **PRD for the workflow**. It captures *what* the workflow must do and the rules it must follow — not *how* AI building blocks will deliver it (that's Step 3, Design).

The output is a **Workflow Requirements** document written in clear, concise requirements language. It must be self-contained enough that a reader who never saw this conversation — including the Design skill or any agent model — can act on it without re-interviewing the user.

## The Two Paths

Step 2 has **two paths**, mapped directly to the two ways students think about a workflow:

| Path | When to use | Mental model |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| **Step-driven** *(a known-steps workflow)* | The work runs the same way each run — you can describe how it gets done, even if the steps aren't mapped yet. Design will classify it as a **deterministic or guided** workflow — both run on steps you own. | "I know how the work gets done" |
| **Goal-driven** *(an agent system)* | You know what "done" looks like, but the work takes different steps depending on what comes in — so you give an agent system a goal and let it figure out the steps at runtime. Design classifies these as **autonomous**. | "I know the goal" |

Both paths produce a Workflow Requirements document with the same shared shell — only the middle "what does the workflow do" block differs.

**What "goal" means here.** An agent goal is a **deliverable with a completion state** — something you can look at after a single run and verify is done. It is *not* a business objective or an impact metric: "higher revenue" is a business objective (record it in `Value & Measurement` → Business Objective); "a ranked list of 20 qualified prospects matching our ICP, with contact info" is an agent goal. The goal bundles the deliverable plus the rules and acceptance criteria for it — what major agent frameworks call the expected output and success criteria. (If you know the product-management "outcomes over outputs" framing: the agent's goal is closer to an *output* — the business outcome belongs in Business Objective.) The defining trait of this path is **who owns the control flow**: the agent decides the *path* to the goal at runtime, while you own the *definition of done*. Note the inverse doesn't hold — a step-driven workflow can still use an agent for an individual step; what makes a workflow goal-driven is that the agent decides the overall sequence, not merely that agents are involved.

**Which path? (the test to share with the user).** *Could you write down every path the work can take?* The choice depends on the **nature of the work**, never on whether the user has the steps written down.
- **Step-driven** if yes — the paths are listable, even if there are branches. A three-way triage ("refund → A, partnership → B, spam → C") is step-driven: the branches are decision points the interview captures, and Design can build them as a routing skill.
- **Goal-driven** if no — the path depends on what the agent finds along the way, so nobody can list it in advance. You define what "done" looks like plus the rules, and the agent figures out the steps at runtime.

Worked example: *"Generate my weekly status report from the same three sources"* → step-driven. *"Research any company I name and tell me whether we should partner with them"* → goal-driven (what to read next depends on what the last source said). Getting this right matters: the choice selects the requirements template Design parses, so a wrong pick creates rework downstream.

**First workflow steer.** If this is the user's first workflow with the framework (no prior workflow folders in `outputs/` and no Workflow nodes beyond backlog stubs, or they say so), say: "For your first workflow, choose step-driven — it becomes a skill you can run by name, which is the fastest way to learn the whole loop. Goal-driven is a good second workflow." Their call if they insist.

## Workflow

**Set expectations up front (first message) — give the agenda, not just the time.** Say: "This is the most thorough conversation in the framework — about 45–60 minutes on your own, less if you've done it before — because everything built later comes from what we capture here. It runs in five chapters: (1) **what this is worth**, (2) **scope and a name**, (3) **mapping how the work gets done**, (4) **improving it for AI**, and (5) **how you'll judge the output**. Stopping early is safe: progress saves to files, and 'continue my workflow' picks up where we left off." Signpost each transition as you reach it ("Chapter 3 of 5 — mapping the steps"). For goal-driven workflows chapter 3 is "defining the goal and its range" and chapter 4 is skipped; say so when you reach it.

> **Registry entry:** the workflow's registry entry is its Workflow concept node in the workspace's `registry/` bundle — see `indexing-registry/references/registry-bundle.md` (in this plugin) for resolution, write rules, and your fields. If the workspace has no `registry/SCHEMA.md`, offer the `scaffolding-registry` skill first (it also migrates legacy `workflow.yaml` workspaces); do not write registry entries until the bundle exists.

#### Phase 1 — Scenario discovery

Determine how the user is arriving and which path to take.

**From Analyze output**: If the user references an opportunity report, file path (e.g., `outputs/ai-opportunity-report.md`), or a specific workflow candidate from an Analyze session, read the Workflow Candidate Summary from the file. Present the available candidates and ask which one to deconstruct. Pre-populate scenario metadata (name, description, trigger, deliverable, autonomy, involvement) from the candidate fields. If the candidate includes a `Lens` field, carry it forward along with any `Business Objective`, `Stakeholders`, and `Success Metrics` fields. Confirm the pre-populated details with the user. Then choose the path: if the candidate's autonomy = Autonomous, suggest goal-driven but still confirm. Otherwise confirm the path from the candidate's description using the describe-first flow below.

**Cold entry (no Analyze output)**: Do not open with the path question. First ask, in one line: "Tell me about the workflow — what kicks it off, what you do, and what comes out the other end. Rough is fine." Listen for whether the paths are listable. Then **propose** the path with the reason, and confirm:

> "From what you've described this sounds **step-driven** — the same steps run each time, with a couple of decision points we'll capture. (The other path, **goal-driven**, is for work where the steps depend on what the agent finds along the way.) Shall we go step-driven?"

Use only the words *step-driven* and *goal-driven* here. Do not introduce "deterministic", "guided", "autonomous", "known-steps workflow", or "agent system" at this point — autonomy vocabulary is taught in Design, where it is explained properly.

When rendering this choice as a structured form (option cards), both cards state the test in the user's terms — "I could write down every path" vs. "the path depends on what it finds" — and a third "Not sure — help me figure out the right workflow" option invites the user in.

**Problem-first handling (no separate path)**: If the user says they don't have a process *or* a goal — just a problem ("People drop off during onboarding and I don't have a way to follow up") — propose a candidate workflow based on what they describe, then route into one of the two paths:
> "Here's a candidate workflow that would solve this: [outline]. Do you want to refine these steps with me (step-driven), or just describe the goal and let an agent figure out the steps (goal-driven)?"

**After the path is chosen, gather scenario details:**
- **Step-driven**: Ask about the business scenario, objective, high-level steps, and ownership. One question at a time. If no lens was established, determine it: individual tasks (one person's repetitive work) = Individual lens; multi-role or business-objective processes = Organizational lens. Ask only if not obvious from context. Proceed to Phase 2 (scope check) → Phase 3 (naming) → Phase 4 (deep dive).
- **Goal-driven**: Proceed to Phase 2 (scope check) → Phase 3 (naming) → Phase 4 (goal-driven), the goal interview. The interview opens with scenario grounding, so don't pre-interview here — but if the user has already described the situation, trigger, or consumer, carry those answers forward.

**Value case (both paths)** — Say: "Chapter 1 of 5 — what this is worth." Bridge into it: "Before we map anything, I want to know what this is worth to you, so that when it's built we can show the improvement rather than just claim it." Then capture four of the six `Value & Measurement` fields, conversationally: two or three questions, not a form.

- **Business Objective** — which strategic objective this supports. On the Individual lens it may be personal ("get my Fridays back"); don't push organizational language onto it.
- **Desired Outcome** — what changes, and for whom, when this works. In the language the business would use, not the workflow's.
- **Measure** — what gets counted: cycle time, error rate, hours, volume, rework.
- **Baseline** — today's number, and how you got it: `Measured`, `Estimated`, or `Unknown`.

Two rules while asking:

- **Measure quantifies Desired Outcome; it does not replace it.** "Cycle time 12 days to 4 days" says nothing about what got better or for whom. If the outcome could be deleted without the measure becoming ambiguous, push once for the outcome.
- **`Unknown` is an acceptable baseline — do not push past it.** If the user doesn't know today's number, record `Unknown — must measure before go-live` and move on. Never offer an estimate to fill the gap: an invented baseline makes a false improvement provable, which is worse than having none.

**From an Analyze report** — Analyze's `Business Objective` and `Success Metrics` are Organizational-lens only. When an Organizational candidate is referenced, pre-populate Business Objective from Analyze's field of the same name and Measure from its `Success Metrics`, then confirm rather than asking cold. Analyze captures neither Desired Outcome nor Baseline, so ask for both.

`Target` and `Readable When` are **not** asked here — they describe the revised workflow, which doesn't exist yet. They come at Phase 12.

#### Phase 2 — Scope check

Say: "Chapter 2 of 5 — scope and a name."

**One trigger, one deliverable.** A workflow has exactly one trigger (what kicks it off) and one deliverable (the tangible output). Test for multiple workflows by checking:

- **Triggers**: Multiple independent starting points? (e.g., "when a lead comes in" vs. "end of each week") → separate workflows
- **Deliverables**: Distinct outputs at different points? If someone receives a deliverable midway and the process continues toward a different output → workflow boundary
- **Timeframes**: Parts run on different schedules (daily vs. weekly), or significant waits between phases → likely separate workflows
- **Step count**: Would this expand to 15+ refined steps? → may be multiple workflows
- **Ownership boundary** (organizational lens): Does this process have a single accountable owner for the end-to-end outcome? If different people own different segments with no single owner, it may be multiple workflows.

If multiple workflows are detected: map out each one (working name, trigger, deliverable), present the breakdown, confirm boundaries with the user, and ask which to deconstruct first. Proceed with only the chosen workflow.

#### Phase 3 — Name the workflow

Present 2-3 name options. Naming conventions: a **2-4 word noun phrase** in **Title Case**, self-explanatory without context (e.g., "Lead Qualification", "Newsletter Distribution", "Student Onboarding"). Prefer `[Subject] [Action]` patterns — "Invoice Generation", "Inbox Triage" — over verb phrases or vague labels. Confirm name, description, goal, and trigger.

**Derive the workflow ID.** Convert the confirmed name to kebab-case (lowercase, hyphens, no punctuation — "Lead Qualification" → `lead-qualification`) and confirm it with the user: "I'll use `lead-qualification` as the workflow ID — it names the folder and files for everything we produce." This ID is the single source of truth for all artifact paths; every downstream skill uses it verbatim.

#### Phase 4 — Deep dive

*Step-driven only.* Say: "Chapter 3 of 5 — mapping how the work gets done." Open by stating the shape of what's coming: "You named [N] steps. We'll take them one at a time — for the first one I'll ask questions; from the second onward I'll propose what I think each step involves and you correct me, which is faster." Then briefly frame what "context" means: "As we go through each step, I'll ask about the *context* it needs. Context is any data or information the step requires to do its job — that includes databases and spreadsheets, but also documents, transcripts, emails, style guides, SOPs, or even knowledge that currently lives in someone's head. If the step needs it, it's context."

Work through each step using the 6-question framework. **Ask one question at a time, adapt to the user's answers, and skip dimensions already well-covered — this is a scaffold for *you*, never a checklist to read aloud at the user.** These six dimensions shape what to ask, not how the spec is structured. Your job is to gather enough signal across all six to write the per-step requirements block (Goal / Inputs / Outputs / Rules & Edge Cases / Context Needed) in Phase 13.

- Discrete steps (is this actually multiple steps?)
- Decision points (if/then branches, quality gates)
- Data flows (inputs, outputs, sources, destinations)
- External actions (does this step *create, update, send, or delete* in an external system — a CRM record, an email, a calendar event, a database row? Flag it as a **write/action**, distinct from read-only context use. Name the action plainly; you're capturing the *requirement*, not the connector. Design will feasibility-check whether the chosen integration can actually perform it — a common failure is a connector that's read-only or simply has no such capability.)
- Context needs (specific documents, files, reference materials)
- Failure modes (what happens when this step fails)
- Context readiness (adopt a data strategist lens for each step's context inputs — **sample these probes, don't interrogate: ask the one or two that matter for this step rather than all four every time**):
  - Access: Where does this context live today? How do you access it — is it in a system with programmatic access (database, cloud app, shared drive), or does it require manual steps (logging in, copy-pasting, reading from a screen)?
  - Interpretability: Is the context in a format AI can process? (Structured: database tables, spreadsheets, JSON. Semi-structured: emails, documents with consistent formatting. Unstructured: handwritten notes, images, proprietary formats.)
  - Persistence: Does this context need to exist as a durable artifact that AI can access across workflow runs? If it's currently "in someone's head" or communicated verbally, flag that it needs to be externalized and stored somewhere AI-accessible.
  - Reorganization signal: If access, interpretability, or persistence is limited, flag that the context may need to be made more accessible or better organized — note this as a consideration for the Design step.
- Role transitions (organizational lens with multiple stakeholders only) — Who performs this step? Does ownership change between steps? Are there handoff points?

When probing context needs, push beyond vague answers — identify the specific artifact. For any step where AI is already being used, ask specifically for existing prompt instructions, project instructions, or system prompts — these contain workflow logic that must be carried into the generated skill — add them to the Context Inventory so Build can read them.

**Misroute check (after the second or third step).** If every step so far turns out to be "it depends on what I find" with no listable branches, say so and offer to switch: "The path here seems to depend on what turns up rather than on rules we can write down — the goal-driven path would capture this better. Want to switch? I'll carry everything we've gathered." This mirrors the goal-driven interview's check in the other direction.

#### Phase 5 — Propose and react

*Step-driven only.* After the first step of the deep dive, switch to propose-and-react: propose a hypothesis across all dimensions (including context readiness and role transitions for organizational workflows) and ask "What's right, what's wrong, what am I missing?" instead of asking each question individually. Include a context readiness hypothesis: "I think this context lives in [location] and is in [format] which AI can interpret. Is that right?"

#### Phase 6 — Map sequence

*Step-driven only.* After all steps, identify sequential vs. parallel steps and the critical path.

#### Phase 7 — Human gates

*Step-driven only.* Ask once, after the sequence is mapped: "Where must a person review or approve before the workflow continues — and where should it just run?" Record each answer as a row `G1, G2, …` in Human Gates with the step it sits at. If the answer is "nowhere — I'll review the final output", write: "No human gates — the workflow runs end-to-end with final review only." Distinguish a gate from a prohibition: "never send without approval" is a gate; "never send" is a Prohibited action for Security, Privacy & Safety.

#### Phase 8 — Workflow-level rules

*Step-driven only.* The deep dive captured per-step edge cases. Now ask for the rules that apply to the whole workflow, one at a time: "What must it always do? What must it never do? What's out of scope? Any tone, format, or length rules? And when it hits a case it can't confidently handle — stop and ask you, do its best and flag it, or skip that item?" Record as `R1…` rows in Rules & Constraints. Keep these behavioral; data-and-authority constraints belong in Security, Privacy & Safety. If fallback is "stop and ask", also add a Human Gate row.

#### Phase 9 — Optimize for AI

*Step-driven only.* Now that the full process is mapped, step back and challenge it. The user described their *current* process — but an AI-powered version may not need every step. Present optimization recommendations for the user to react to. Look for:

- **Eliminable steps** — Steps that exist only because a human was doing the work. Examples: manual data transfer between systems (an integration eliminates this), reformatting output from one step to match the input of the next (AI handles format natively), or "wait for X to be available" steps that become instant with API access.
- **Collapsible steps** — Adjacent steps that AI can do in a single pass. Examples: separate "draft" and "format" steps, or "research" followed immediately by "summarize findings" — these are distinct for humans but one operation for AI.
- **Parallelizable steps** — Steps that were sequential only because a human can do one thing at a time. If two steps have no data dependency, flag that AI can run them concurrently.
- **Simplifiable handoffs** — Handoffs or review gates that exist because of human error rates, not genuine decision points. An AI quality check might replace a human review loop, or a multi-step approval chain might collapse to a single human gate on the final output.
- **New steps needed** — Occasionally the AI version needs a step the human version didn't: a validation check, a data enrichment pass, or an explicit context-loading step that was implicit when a human just "knew" the background.

**Present as a propose-and-react summary:**

> "Chapter 4 of 5 — improving it for AI. You've described how the work happens *today*, with a person doing it. An AI-powered version usually doesn't need every one of those steps — some exist only because a human was doing the work. Here's how I'd reshape it:
> - **Eliminate**: [step(s)] — [reason, e.g., 'direct access to your CRM data replaces the manual export']
> - **Collapse**: [step(s)] into one — [reason, e.g., 'AI drafts and formats in a single pass']
> - **Parallelize**: [step(s)] — [reason, e.g., 'no data dependency between these']
> - **Simplify**: [handoff/gate] — [reason, e.g., 'AI evaluation replaces manual QA, human reviews final output only']
> - **Add**: [new step] — [reason, e.g., 'need an explicit context-loading step for data the human carried in their head']
>
> These are recommendations — you may have reasons to keep steps as-is (compliance, audit trail, stakeholder expectations). What looks right, and what should stay?"

Update the refined steps based on the user's confirmed optimizations. Renumber if steps were added, removed, or merged. If the user rejects all optimizations, that's fine — proceed with the original steps.

#### Phase 10 — Validate the workflow

*Step-driven only.* Before consolidating context, walk through the refined workflow end-to-end and present a validation summary. This is the quality gate that catches gaps before the workflow moves to Design. Check for:

- **Completeness** — Are there gaps in the end-to-end flow? Steps where an output doesn't connect to the next step's input?
- **Logic gaps** — Decision points without clear criteria? Steps that assume information not produced by a prior step?
- **Edge cases** — Scenarios the user hasn't mentioned (empty inputs, unexpected formats, partial data, exception paths)?
- **Redundancy** — Steps that duplicate work or produce outputs no downstream step consumes?
- **Handoff clarity** — For each step transition: is it clear what passes from one step to the next, and in what form?

Present as a validation summary:

> "Let me validate the workflow before we finalize it. Walking through the end-to-end flow, here's what I found:
> - **[Finding type]**: [specific gap, e.g., 'Step 3 produces a draft but Step 4 expects a formatted document — is there an implicit formatting step?']
> - **[Finding type]**: [specific gap]
> - **No issues found in**: [what checked out]
>
> Which of these need to be addressed?"

Update refined steps based on the user's responses. If no issues are found, say so and proceed.

#### Phase 11 — Consolidate context

Present a rolled-up "context inventory" of every piece of context the workflow needs — documents, data, rules, examples, and any other knowledge from the user's domain that the model doesn't have.

For step-driven workflows: assemble from per-step context needs gathered in Phase 4. For goal-driven workflows: assemble from the Inputs + Context Sources gathered in Phase 4 (goal-driven).

**Then classify each artifact and settle sensitivity.** As you present the rolled-up inventory, fill the `Sensitivity` and `Provenance` columns for every row — what class of data it holds, and whether someone on the team wrote it or it came from outside.

Those two columns answer two of the three sensitivity tests, so **derive them rather than asking again**:

- any row `Confidential` or `Regulated` → **handles data the user would be uncomfortable seeing outside the company**
- any row `External` → **consumes content nobody on the team authored**

Frame the check in one line first: "Two quick checks on what this workflow has to protect, then we're done mapping and can move to how you'll judge it." Then:

Ask only the third: **"Does this workflow write to anything live — send, post, create, or change something in a real system?"** (Running unattended is the higher-risk form of the same thing, so it counts.)

Deriving matters. If this were a free-standing question, a user could mark an artifact `Confidential` during the deep dive and then answer "no" here, producing a document that says both "this handles confidential data" and "no sensitivity constraints."

**If anything is tripped**, work the `Security, Privacy & Safety` categories — but only the ones the tripped tests implicate:

| What tripped | Categories to work |
|---|---|
| Writes to a live system | **Prohibited actions** (what it must never do, whoever asks) and **Traceability** (what has to be recorded, so a run can be reconstructed afterwards) |
| An `External` row | **Boundaries** (where that content may travel) and **Prohibited actions** (what it may never be allowed to trigger) |
| A `Confidential` row | **Boundaries** (where the data may travel) and **Access** (who may see the outputs and intermediate state) |
| A `Regulated` row | Boundaries and Access as above, plus the **governing regime**, which is required |

Work each implicated category once, even when two tests point at the same one. Capture a Source for every constraint; `Self` when the user is the source.

**If nothing is tripped**, write the one-line form and move on: "No sensitivity constraints — personal data only, read-only, human-triggered." Do not walk five categories to arrive at nothing.

**Either way, a stated prohibition is always written down.** Any "never do" the user already gave you — the ones Phase 7 separated from gates on the step-driven path, or the rules question on the goal-driven one — goes under `Prohibited actions`, whichever categories the table above implicates. If nothing was tripped but the user did state a "never do", the section is not one line: write `Prohibited actions` with that constraint and its Source, and open the section with "No sensitivity constraints beyond the prohibition(s) below — personal data only, read-only, human-triggered."

#### Phase 12 — Define how you will judge the output

*Both paths.* This is the last chapter. Open it by saying what it is for, in plain words, before asking anything:

> "Chapter 5 of 5 — how you'll judge the output. In Step 5 you'll run this workflow on a few realistic inputs and check whether the output did what you needed. I want to capture *how you'll judge it* now, while you know the work best, so that step is a checklist and not a gut feel. Each thing you tell me becomes one line the workflow either meets or doesn't."

Then ask, one at a time, in this order:

1. **Real example first.** "Do you have a recent output of this work that you were happy with — one you'd point to and say 'exactly like that'?" If yes, ask for it (paste, attach, or a Context Inventory ID) and read it before asking anything else. If a document, add it to the Context Inventory and reference its ID. If they paste it into the chat rather than pointing at a file, save it as `outputs/[workflow-name]/context/C<n>-<short-name>.md`, use that path as its `Location / Source` in the Context Inventory, and refer to it by that `C…` ID in the Golden Example column. If none exists, that's fine and move on — but if the user produces this output today, a recent good one usually does.
2. **Derive the criteria from the example.** Looking at the example (or, if none, at the Goal), propose the qualities that make it good as **numbered yes/no statements**: "Looking at this, it seems you care that (1) every row has contact info, (2) it uses your three headings, (3) it stays under a page. Is that the list? What's missing?" Every statement must be answerable Met / Not met from one run's output. Sharpen soft qualities until they are checkable: "tone is good" → "I could send this without editing the wording"; "matches our style" → "uses our headings and stays under one page". Never record a scale word ("mostly", "somewhat", "1–5"). For goal-driven workflows, also seed the list from the rejection-test answers captured in question 3 of the goal-driven interview — each "I'd send it back because…" is a criterion; confirm and fill gaps rather than re-eliciting.
3. **The one that matters most.** "If it got everything else right but missed one of these, which one would make you send it back?" Mark that criterion (or two) with **(must)** — Test reports it first.
4. **Realistic inputs to try — I draft, you correct.** Ask first: "Give me one or two *real* inputs you've actually handled recently — the one you'd run this on tomorrow." Take what they give you. Then propose the rest, to 3–5 in total, each aimed at one thing that could go wrong, and say what each one tests — in this order, and only where it applies: the typical case; a hard case taken from a step's edge cases (goal-driven: from the variation envelope); an empty or malformed input; one that exercises a **Must never** rule (`R…`) or a human gate (`G…`); and, only when the Context Inventory has an `External` source row, an input that carries an instruction addressed to the AI. When you say each one out loud, name the risk in plain words — "this one checks it never contacts someone we've already emailed" — not the label: the user has not seen `R…` or `G…` yet. The labels go in the file, and the closing preview introduces them. Propose only inputs the user could actually put their hands on — something they have, or something they could write in a minute — never one that needs a record or a system they do not have. Then hand it back: "Change any of these, replace them, or drop them — we want 3–5, with at least one real one and at least one hard one. If you couldn't get hold of an input for one of these by tomorrow, say so and we'll swap it: in Step 5 you'll need something real to paste in for every one of these." These become Example Scenarios E1…E5. **Once the user has confirmed the set, save every scenario's input as its own file** at `outputs/[workflow-name]/inputs/E<n>-<short-name>.md`, where `<short-name>` is the scenario's short name in kebab-case and no more than three or four words — a real input exactly as the user gave it, a proposed input written out in full so it can be pasted as-is. If a real input was named or described rather than pasted ("last Friday's tracker export"), ask for it now — "paste it in and I'll save it, so Step 5 is copy-and-paste rather than a hunt" — and only if they genuinely can't get hold of it today, write the file with a single placeholder line naming exactly what to paste in before Step 5, and tell them that is what the file holds. Then begin that scenario's `Input` cell with that path in backticks, then ` — `, then the short description. Write `(real)` or `(proposed)` at the end of each Scenario cell, and end each "What to look for in the output" cell with what it tests (`; tests R2, G1`, or `; tests the Step 2 duplicate-company edge case`). For goal-driven workflows, take the real inputs and the hard case from the variation envelope captured in question 4 of the goal-driven interview rather than re-asking, then propose the rest the same way — harvested inputs get saved to files and written into the `Input` cell path-first like any other scenario.
5. **Golden example per scenario.** Ask only about the `(real)` scenarios: "Do you have a past output for an input like this that was exactly right?" Record it in the Golden Example column (Context Inventory ID, short excerpt, or "—"). A `(proposed)` scenario has no past output by construction — write "—", and never write a golden example you generated yourself. That is what guarantees at least one scenario runs without a golden example, so Test can see whether the workflow generalizes.

**Then close `Value & Measurement`** with the two fields that describe the revised workflow:

6. "Now that we've reshaped this — what should the number be? What's the target?"
7. "How long after this goes live before that number can actually be read?"

These wait until now because a target describes the *revised* workflow. For step-driven workflows, read the target alongside `Optimization Notes`. For goal-driven workflows the target compares the agent system against however the work happens today; say which.

**Closing preview.** Before generating the file, show the user the report card Test will fill in, so they see where their answers go:

> "Here's what Step 5 will check, per input you gave me:
>
> | Expected | From | Result | Evidence |
> |---|---|---|---|
> | Every row has contact info | AC1 (must) | — | — |
> | Uses our three headings | AC2 | — | — |
> | Never includes someone we've already contacted | R3 | — | — |
> | Pauses before sending | G1 | — | — |
>
> I've saved each of those inputs as its own file under `outputs/[name]/inputs/`, so nothing has to be reconstructed later. In Step 5 you'll open the file for a scenario, paste it into a new chat and run it, then say *test this* and I'll grade it there.

> The workflow is ready when every line is Met on every input — or when you've looked at a miss and decided you can live with it. I've written these as your *acceptance criteria* (AC1…), *rules* (R1…), and *human gates* (G1…) in the file; those are the labels Test uses."

#### Phase 13 — Generate Workflow Requirements

Produce the structured Workflow Requirements document and write it to the output file. See the **Output** section below for the template, writing style, and machine-readability rules.

**Self-check before finishing (so Design can parse it).** After writing, verify the file against the machine-readability rules and fix any miss before handing off:
- File lives in the workflow folder using the kebab-case ID: `outputs/[workflow-name]/requirements.md` (e.g., "Inbound Lead Triage" → `outputs/inbound-lead-triage/requirements.md`), and the workflow's Workflow node has `status: under-development` and the requirements path linked under `# Artifacts`.
- Every scenario's input file exists at the exact path its `Input` cell names, and holds the input itself — a real one verbatim, a proposed one written out in full — not a description of it — or, where the user could not supply a real input today, the single placeholder line Phase 12 allows, and nothing invented in its place. Write any that are missing before finishing.
- All required headings are present and **exactly named** (no synonyms): Goal, Value & Measurement, Metadata, Context Inventory, Acceptance Criteria, Example Scenarios, Rules & Constraints, Human Gates, Security, Privacy & Safety, plus the path-specific middle (Steps Overview + Step Details + Sequence for step-driven; Inputs for goal-driven).
- Canonical vocabulary used exactly (Definition Type, Lens, Context Status, AI Accessible) and stable IDs present (steps 1,2,3…; context C1…; scenarios E1…; criteria AC1…; rules R1…; gates G1…).
- If anything is off, fix it before telling the user it's ready.

#### Phase 4 (goal-driven) — Goal interview

When the user selects goal-driven, run this interview instead of the step-driven deep dive (Phases 4–10). The goal-driven path handles context discovery internally (question 8, Context & Data Sources), so it skips straight to Phase 11 (Consolidate Context) → Phase 12 (Acceptance Criteria) → Phase 13 (Generate) after the interview. Same interview principles apply: one question at a time, propose-and-react after the first few answers, push beyond vague answers. If scenario discovery (Phase 1) already captured the situation, trigger, or consumer, build on those answers — confirm and deepen rather than re-asking from scratch.

**Open with a frame** so the user knows what this path asks of them (parallel to the context frame the step-driven path opens with):

> "This path is for when you know what you want but not the exact steps — you don't need to map anything out. You'll give the agent system a goal — a concrete deliverable it produces each run — plus the rules it has to follow, and I'll handle the structure. Let's start with the situation."

1. **Scenario (ground before sharpening)**: "Tell me about the situation — what's going on, what kicks this off, and what are you trying to get done?" Plain language; no precision demanded yet. This grounds the trigger, the consumer, and the business context before the goal is sharpened. Note any business objective the user states ("we need more pipeline") — it goes in `Value & Measurement` → Business Objective, not in the goal.
2. **Goal (natural, then reflect back)**: "Now the result: when a run works well, what do you walk away with? Talk like you're describing it to a colleague — don't worry about being precise." Then **reflect back a structured restatement** that covers all three of **format, structure, and scope** — plus who consumes it — and names the completion state: "So the goal is roughly [restatement], and a run is done when [completion state]. Did I get that right, or what's off?" The reflect-back is where the rigor lives; don't drop any of format/structure/scope. If the user struggles, offer a vague-vs-sharp calibration example (e.g., "'Help me with prospecting' is a start — what I'm after is more like 'a ranked list of 20 qualified prospects matching our ICP, with contact info and a one-line fit rationale, every Monday'").
3. **Goal pressure-test (challenge before accepting)**: After the reflect-back, test the goal — don't just record it. Apply whichever of these three tests the answer hasn't already passed, state which test failed and why when pushing back, and cap the challenge at 2–3 probes (interview, not interrogation):
   - **Done/not-done test (completion state)**: "If the agent handed you one run's output, could you say 'done' or 'not done' just by looking at it?" — "Improve our pipeline" fails; "a ranked list of 20 prospects with contact info" passes. If it fails, push for the concrete deliverable.
   - **Level test (business objective vs. agent goal)**: If the stated goal is metric-shaped with no deliverable ("higher revenue", "more engagement"), ladder *down*: "That's the business objective — I'll record it under what this is worth. What's the *thing* the agent hands you that contributes to it?" If it's hopelessly vague ("help with email"), sharpen via format, structure, and scope.
   - **Rejection test (testability)**: "Describe an output that *looks* plausible but you'd send back. What's wrong with it?" The answers surface implicit acceptance criteria — carry them forward to seed Phase 12; don't re-elicit there.

   If the user's first answer in question 2 is purely metric-shaped (no deliverable at all), skip the reflect-back and go straight to the level test. If the probe cap is reached and the goal is still untestable, switch from asking to proposing: draft a sharp candidate goal yourself from everything heard so far and ask the user to confirm or correct it — never proceed to question 4 with a goal that fails the done/not-done test.
4. **Variation envelope**: "This works as goal-driven because the work takes different steps depending on what comes in. What's the range it needs to handle? Give me the typical case, and a couple of the awkward or harder ones." These answers become the real inputs and the hard case among the Example Scenarios in Phase 12 — capture them now and harvest them there (the model proposes the rest there); don't re-elicit scenarios later. **Misroute check:** if the answer reveals the work actually takes the same steps every time (no meaningful variation), say so and offer to switch: "This sounds like it runs the same way each run — the step-driven path would capture it better. Want to switch?" Carry everything gathered so far into the step-driven deep dive rather than restarting.
5. **Inputs**: "What kicks it off, and what does the agent system get to work with — data, documents, access?" (Confirm against what the scenario already established rather than re-asking.)
6. **Rules & Constraints**: "What rules should the agent follow? Things it must always do, must never do, or limits on scope, tone, length." Keep this **behavioral**. Where data may travel and what the agent may never *act* on — send, post, create, change — are captured at Phase 11 under `Security, Privacy & Safety`, not here.
7. **Fallback behavior**: "When it hits a case it can't confidently handle — missing info, something ambiguous — what should it do? Stop and ask you, make its best attempt and flag it, or skip that item?" This is the agent's behavior on *unplanned* exceptions — distinct from the *planned* pauses captured under Human gates. Record it under Rules & Constraints in the output. If the answer is "stop and ask," also capture it as a Human Gate (question 9) so the pause appears where Design looks for review points.
8. **Context & Data Sources**: "What external systems, data sources, documents, or reference materials should the agent system have access to?" Apply the same context readiness probing as the step-driven path (sample — ask the one or two probes that matter, don't run all three mechanically):
   - Access: Where does this context live today? Is it in a system with programmatic access (database, cloud app, shared drive), or does it require manual steps (logging in, copy-pasting, reading from a screen)?
   - Interpretability: Is the context in a format AI can process?
   - Persistence: Does this context need to exist as a durable artifact that AI can access across workflow runs?
9. **Human gates**: "Where should the agent system pause for human review? Or run end-to-end with final review only?"
10. **Scope check**: Same one-trigger-one-deliverable test as Phase 2 — confirm the goal hasn't expanded into multiple workflows.

**Do NOT ask about capability domains, agent count, model class, tools, or orchestration approach.** Those are Design decisions. Goal-driven Deconstruct stays in "what" territory: goal, inputs, acceptance criteria, rules, context, human gates.

#### Phase 10 (goal-driven) — Validate

Step-driven has a Phase 10 validation gate; goal-driven needs the equivalent so a vague goal or missing guardrails doesn't sail through to Design. Walk the definition end-to-end and present a short validation summary covering:

- **Goal is bounded, singular, and testable** — one clear deliverable that passes the done/not-done test ("help with email" is too vague; "a drafted reply per inbound inquiry" is bounded). If you can't tell from one run's output whether the goal is met, tighten it before Design.
- **Variation range is captured** — the typical case and the awkward/edge cases are identified (these become the real and hard test scenarios in Phase 12).
- **Rules are sufficient** — must-do and must-never both covered; scope boundaries explicit enough to keep the agent in bounds.
- **Fallback behavior is defined** — it's clear what the agent does when it can't confidently complete a case.
- **Context is reachable** — every context/data source named has a known location and an access path (not "it's in my head" or a login-only portal with no plan to bridge it).
- **Human gates are defined** — it's clear where (if anywhere) a human reviews, and that final-review-only is a deliberate choice.

Present as: "Before I finalize, here's a quick check of your goal-driven definition: [findings]. Which of these should we tighten?" Update based on the user's answers. If all clear, say so and proceed.

After completing the interview and Phase 10 (goal-driven), proceed directly to Phase 11 (Consolidate Context) → Phase 12 (Acceptance Criteria) → Phase 13 (Generate Workflow Requirements) using the goal-driven output format.

## Output

Write the Workflow Requirements to `outputs/[workflow-name]/requirements.md` where `[workflow-name]` is the kebab-case workflow ID confirmed in Phase 3 (e.g., `outputs/lead-qualification/requirements.md`). Create the folder if it doesn't exist.

### Registry write

Deconstruct writes to the Workflow node in `registry/workflows/<slug>.md`: sets `status: under-development`, `definition_type` (`step-driven` or `goal-driven`), refines `trigger` and `description`, and links the Requirements doc in `# Artifacts`. Merge into an existing stub node (one `analyze` or `naming-workflows` created) — never overwrite fields a student set through a framework step; a stub's provisional `trigger` may be replaced with a better-informed value here, and Design does the same for `execution_mode` (see the ownership table in `registry-bundle.md`). See `indexing-registry/references/registry-bundle.md` for write rules and the full field-ownership table.

Then invoke the `indexing-registry` skill for a maintenance pass (best-effort — a failed refresh never fails this step).

Conventions every framework skill follows (stated here once; downstream skills apply them):

- **Read the Workflow node on load** to locate artifacts and confirm you're working on the right workflow.
- **Resume orientation ("continue my workflow").** Any framework skill can be the re-entry point. When the user says "continue my workflow" (or invokes a skill without context), check `registry/workflows/` for existing Workflow nodes and infer progress from what each node already links — its `# Artifacts` labels, plus its `# Skills` / `# Agents` links for Step 4 (see `registry-bundle.md` § Framework progress). If several nodes exist, list them and ask which to continue. Then orient before doing anything: "You've completed through Step [N] ([name]) — next is Step [N+1] ([name])." If the invoked skill doesn't match the next step, say so and route to the right one instead of re-running finished work.
- **Never silently overwrite.** If your output file already exists from a previous run, rename the old one with a date suffix (e.g., `requirements-2026-06-10.md`) before writing.
- **Legacy layout:** if no workflow folder exists but flat files like `outputs/[name]-requirements.md` (or a requirements-like file at the workspace root) do, use those paths and offer to create the folder. If the workspace has no registry bundle yet, the `scaffolding-registry` skill handles migrating any legacy layout when it creates one.
- **No persistent workspace:** if this environment can't keep files between conversations (no project workspace — files are produced as downloads), tell the user after each write: "Save this file — you'll re-supply it when you run the next step, or continue the next step in this conversation." On load, if the expected files aren't present, ask the user to reconnect your registry repo via the GitHub connector, or re-upload the bundle folder, instead of failing.

### Writing-style rules (MUST follow)

The output reads like a PRD, not an interview transcript. Enforce:

- **Requirements voice.** Every bullet is a statement of what must be true, not a description of what the user said. Prefer "The step accepts a list of prospect URLs" or "Output is a Markdown table with one row per prospect" over "The user mentioned they usually have a list of URLs."
- **Active voice. Present tense.** "Validate the input against the rubric" — not "The input will then be validated."
- **One requirement per line.** Use bulleted lists, not paragraphs, anywhere multiple discrete requirements appear.
- **Concrete over abstract.** Name the artifact, the field, the threshold. "Reject submissions over 500 words" — not "Filter out long submissions."
- **No interview residue.** Drop hedges ("I think", "sometimes", "usually"), narrative connectors ("then the user", "after that"), and meta-commentary about the conversation ("we discussed", "you mentioned").
- **Self-contained.** A reader who never saw the deconstruct conversation can implement against the document.
- **Markdown hygiene.** Don't use a bare `~` for "approximately" — two tildes in one paragraph render as `~~strikethrough~~`. Write "approximately"/"about" (e.g., "about 1–2 pages", "150–250 words"), or keep `~` only inside code spans/backticks.

### Machine-readability rules (MUST follow)

So Design (and any agent model) can parse the document without re-asking:

- **Fixed section headings**, in fixed order — use the exact headings in the template; no synonyms, no reordering.
- **Tables for any list of items with shared fields** (steps, context artifacts, example scenarios) — not prose.
- **Canonical vocabulary** for enumerated values:
  - Definition Type: `Step-Driven` or `Goal-Driven`
  - Lens: `Individual` or `Organizational`
  - Context Status: `Exists` or `Needs Creation`
  - AI Accessible: `Yes`, `Partial`, or `No`
- **Stable IDs** — number steps `1, 2, 3, …`; ID context items `C1, C2, …`; example scenarios `E1, E2, …`; acceptance criteria `AC1, AC2, …`; rules `R1, R2, …`; human gates `G1, G2, …`. Test's report card references these IDs; Design and Build reference C and step IDs.
- **Explicit Inputs and Outputs per step** — even when "obvious." Design uses these to build the data-flow without guessing.

### Template — shared shell

```markdown
# [Workflow Name] — Workflow Requirements

## Goal
[One paragraph: what a successful run produces, when it runs, who consumes the output.]

## Value & Measurement

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Business Objective | [which strategic objective this supports] |
| Desired Outcome | [what changes, and for whom] |
| Measure | [what gets counted] |
| Baseline | [today's number] · Measured / Estimated / Unknown |
| Target | [what the revised workflow should achieve] |
| Readable When | [how long after go-live the number can be read] |

Notes:
- `Baseline: Unknown` is a legitimate value, recorded as `Unknown — must measure before go-live`. An invented baseline is worse than none, because it makes a false improvement provable.
- Measure quantifies Desired Outcome; it does not replace it. If the outcome could be deleted without the measure becoming ambiguous, the outcome was written too thinly.
- On the Individual lens the Business Objective may be personal — "get my Fridays back" is a strategic objective for a person.

## Metadata

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Workflow Name | [name] |
| Description | [short description] |
| Trigger | [what kicks the workflow off] |
| Owner | [person or role] |
| Lens | Individual / Organizational |
| Definition Type | Step-Driven / Goal-Driven |

For organizational lens, also include:
| Stakeholders | [roles/teams involved] |

## Context Inventory

| ID | Artifact | Used By | Status | Sensitivity | Provenance | AI Accessible | Location / Source | Key Contents |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | [name] | [Step IDs or "All"] | Exists / Needs Creation | Public / Internal / Confidential / Regulated | Authored / External | Yes / Partial / No | [path, URL, system name, or "Create as [path]"] | [what's in it] |

Notes:
- **Sensitivity** is what class of data this holds. **Provenance** is whether someone on your team wrote it (`Authored`) or it arrived from outside (`External`). They are different risks and must not be merged: a public web page is `Public` and `External` — low sensitivity, but nobody on your team wrote it. A draft pricing memo is `Confidential` and `Authored` — high sensitivity, but it came from you.
- Content from outside can contain instructions. A model that treats them as instructions does what a stranger told it to, which is why `External` matters even when the content looks harmless.
- Any row marked `Regulated` requires the governing regime to be named in `Security, Privacy & Safety`.
- For items with `Status: Needs Creation`, the Location column captures where the artifact should be persisted — AI must be able to reach it.
- For organizational workflows, include existing process documentation here: SOPs, training guides, compliance requirements, SLAs.

## Acceptance Criteria

Each line is one thing a single run's output either does or does not do. Test checks every line per scenario and records Met / Not met with evidence. Mark the one or two that would make the user send the output back with **(must)**.

1. **AC1 (must)** — [yes/no statement, e.g., "Every prospect row has a name, role, company, and contact email"]
2. **AC2** — [yes/no statement, e.g., "The report uses the three headings from C2 in that order"]
3. **AC3** — [yes/no statement, e.g., "The user could send the draft without editing the wording"]

Reference example: [Context Inventory ID of the real output the criteria were derived from, or "—"]

## Example Scenarios

| ID | Scenario | Input | What to look for in the output | Golden Example |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | [short name] (real) | `outputs/[workflow-name]/inputs/E1-[short-name].md` — [description] | [what makes this output "good"]; tests [AC/R/G IDs, or the named edge case] | [Context Inventory ID, short inline excerpt, or "—"] |
| E2 | [short name] (proposed) | `outputs/[workflow-name]/inputs/E2-[short-name].md` — … | …; tests [IDs] | — |

Every `Input` cell starts with the path to that scenario's saved input file, then the short description — Step 5 opens the file and pastes its contents, so the input never has to be remembered or rebuilt.

Mark a Scenario `(real)` when it is an input the user has actually handled and `(proposed)` when the model suggested it — at least one must be `(real)`. The `; tests …` tail at the end of the "What to look for in the output" cell names the risk that scenario covers; Test carries that text into its report card.

Golden Examples are optional but high-value — Test (Step 5) compares actual output against them instead of relying on gut feel alone. Use "—" when none exists.

## Rules & Constraints

| ID | Type | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| R1 | Must do | [behavioral rule] |
| R2 | Must never do | [behavioral only — see the note below] |
| R3 | Scope | [what's in scope, what's out] |
| R4 | Tone / format / length | [if applicable] |
| R5 | Fallback | [what to do when a case can't be confidently completed — stop and ask, best-effort and flag, or skip] |

Notes:
- This section is **behavioral**: how the work should be done. Constraints about *data and authority* belong in `Security, Privacy & Safety` — where data may travel goes to Boundaries, and anything outward-facing or irreversible goes to Prohibited actions. One fact, one home.
- "Must never do" here means behavioral: never invent a figure, never write in the first person. A prohibition on *acting* — never email a customer, never merge to main — is a Prohibited action.
- When fallback behavior is "stop and ask", also record it as a Human Gate so the pause appears where Design looks for review points.

## Human Gates

| ID | Where | What requires human input |
|---|---|---|
| G1 | [step ID or phase] | [decision, approval, review] |

If no human gates are required, write: "No human gates — the workflow runs end-to-end with final review only."

## Security, Privacy & Safety

*Scope: [which of the sensitivity triple applies — writes to a live system / consumes content nobody on your team authored / handles data you would be uncomfortable seeing outside the company]*

### Boundaries
| Constraint | Source |
|---|---|
| [where data may and may not travel — tenancy, residency, third-party models, retention] | [person, policy, or control ID, or `Self`] |

### Access
| Constraint | Source |
|---|---|
| [who may see outputs and intermediate state] | [...] |

### Traceability
| Constraint | Source |
|---|---|
| [what must be recorded, and for whom] | [...] |

### Prohibited actions
| Constraint | Source |
|---|---|
| [what the workflow must never do — absolute, not conditional] | [...] |

### Governing regime
[GDPR / HIPAA / SOC 2 / internal policy / None — required when any Context Inventory row is `Regulated`]

Notes:
- **When nothing is tripped, the whole section is one line:** "No sensitivity constraints — personal data only, read-only, human-triggered." The exception is a prohibition the user stated outright: keep `Prohibited actions` and open with "No sensitivity constraints beyond the prohibition(s) below — personal data only, read-only, human-triggered."
- **Every constraint carries a Source** — a person, a policy, or a control ID ("Avery, security lead", "SOC 2 CC6.1"). On the Individual lens the user is usually the source: record `Self` rather than leaving it blank. A blank reads as an unsourced assertion; `Self` is honest and reviewable.
- **Prohibited actions are absolute; Human Gates are conditional.** "Never send a customer email without approval" is a gate — not until someone approves. "Never send a customer email" is a prohibition — never, regardless of who asks. If an approval can satisfy it, it belongs in Human Gates.
- **The sensitivity of what the workflow produces belongs in `Access`.** The Context Inventory classifies what the workflow *consumes*. A generated deliverable can be more sensitive than any of its inputs — a specification assembled from customer evidence is the obvious case. Who may see the outputs and the intermediate state is an Access constraint, not a Context Inventory row.

## Optimization Notes (optional, step-driven only)

## Steps Overview

1. [Step name] — [one-line summary]
2. [Step name] — [one-line summary]
3. …

## Step Details

### Step 1 — [Step Name]
- **Goal:** [what this step achieves, one sentence]
- **Inputs:** [data/context coming in — name the artifact or reference a Context Inventory ID]
- **Outputs:** [what passes to the next step]
- **External Action:** [does this step write to an external system? Name the action — e.g., "creates and updates deal records in the CRM", "sends an email", "creates a calendar event" — or "None (read-only)". Design feasibility-checks each of these against the chosen integration.]
- **Rules & Edge Cases:**
  - [decision criterion or branch]
  - [what to do when an input is missing, malformed, or empty]
  - [quality threshold or exception path]
- **Context Needed:** [list of Context Inventory IDs the step depends on, e.g., C1, C3]

```

### Goal-Driven middle block

Insert between the Metadata table and the Context Inventory (omit Steps Overview, Step Details, and Sequence — there is no fixed step sequence for goal-driven workflows):

```markdown
## Inputs

- [What the agent system receives to start — data, materials, references, access]
- [One bullet per discrete input]

```

The Goal, Value & Measurement, Metadata, Context Inventory, Acceptance Criteria, Example Scenarios, Rules & Constraints, Human Gates, and Security, Privacy & Safety sections from the shared shell still apply — goal-driven uses the same shell, just a different middle, so `Inputs` is the only section this block adds. `Rules & Constraints` is collected by question 6 of this interview and written into the shared shell, not here. The **Example Scenarios should reflect the variation envelope** captured in Phase 4 (goal-driven): the typical case plus the awkward/edge cases the agent must handle. Those are the real inputs and the hard case; the model proposes the rest of the 3–5 as in Phase 12, and the user corrects them.

## Guidelines

- Ask one question at a time — never present a wall of questions.
- Probe for missing steps — most people undercount by 30-50%.
- Surface hidden assumptions ("How do you decide when X is good enough?").
- Use plain language; avoid jargon unless the user introduced it.
- Push beyond vague context answers like "domain knowledge" — identify the specific artifact.
- Surface the assumption that existing context — data, documents, transcripts, reference materials — will "just work" for AI. Most people underestimate the work required to make context AI-accessible, especially unstructured content like SOPs, style guides, meeting transcripts, and knowledge that lives in people's heads. Adopt a data strategist lens — help the user see where context reorganization, reformatting, or externalization is needed before they commit to a workflow design that depends on inaccessible context. Push beyond "it's in the CRM" or "I just know it" — ask what system it's in, what format it's in, and whether there's programmatic access or it requires manual steps. Leave specific integration mechanisms (MCP, API, SDK) to the Design step.
- **Stay in the "what" lane.** Deconstruct defines the workflow, its context needs, its rules, and its acceptance criteria. It does not prescribe how AI will access data, which tools to use, what integrations to build, how many agents are needed, or which models to use — those are Design decisions (Step 3). Do not ask the user about capability domains, agent architecture, model class, or orchestration mechanism. If a technology concern surfaces, note it as a consideration for Design rather than resolving it here.
- After writing the Workflow Requirements file, close with what was produced and what happens next: "Workflow Requirements saved to `outputs/[name]/requirements.md`. It holds your goal, [N] steps (or, goal-driven: the goal and its range), [M] context items, [K] acceptance criteria, and [J] test inputs. Step 3, Design, reads this file and decides how the workflow gets built — as a skill or an agent, on your platform — in about 30 minutes. Start it with 'run the design skill'."
- If entering deconstruction without a prior analysis (direct workflow description), determine the lens by asking if not obvious from context.
- For goal-driven workflows, do not force step decomposition — the whole point is to capture what the agent system needs to know without prescribing execution steps.
- **Signpost each phase transition.** The user hears chapters, not phases — announce each transition as its chapter ("Chapter 3 of 5 — mapping the steps") and keep the phase numbers internal, so the user only ever sees one count.
