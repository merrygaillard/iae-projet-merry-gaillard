  This skill should be used to maintain the user's AI Registry — the registry/
  knowledge bundle and its derived views (the REGISTRY.md dashboard, directory
  indexes, GENERATED blocks, and the visual HTML dashboard). Triggers: "update
  my registry", "refresh my registry", "lint my registry", "generate my
  dashboard", "what have I built", "show my AI inventory", after creating
  skills or agents, or when another framework skill's closing step calls for a
  maintenance pass. Also repairs stale or hand-edited derived views. If no
  registry/SCHEMA.md exists, route to the scaffolding-registry skill instead.

# Maintaining the AI Registry

The **AI Registry** is the `registry/` knowledge bundle at the workspace root, plus everything derived from it: directory indexes, GENERATED blocks inside individual nodes, the `REGISTRY.md` dashboard, and — on request — the visual HTML dashboard.

**The registry is derived-state doctrine.** The bundle's node files (under `registry/`) are the source of truth. Every dashboard, index, and summary is generated from them. **Edit sources, regenerate — never hand-edit a derived view.** If a derived view looks wrong, that's a signal to fix the source node and regenerate, not to patch the view directly.

For how nodes are resolved, written, and owned — resolution rules, write rules, the field-ownership table, framework-progress inference, review scheduling, and the full lint rule list — see `references/registry-bundle.md`. This skill assumes that contract; it doesn't restate it.

## Location & Scope

**One workspace = one registry.** The bundle lives at `registry/` off the root of the folder the framework operates in — beside `outputs/`, `sops/`, and `process-guides/`. Where that root is, and how bytes get read and written there, depends on the platform — see the platform matrix in the framework's cross-platform delivery documentation. Tools that can create files write the bundle directly (write mode); tools that cannot print each file with its location for the student to save (print-and-save mode), stating plainly what is unsaved. The bundle may live in a local folder, a synced cloud-drive folder, or a GitHub repository — the skill never assumes a repo.

> **Terminology:** "AI Registry" always means the `registry/` bundle and the views generated from it. It is unrelated to the framework's *platform registry* (`registries/platform-registry.json`), which catalogs platforms and integrations for the Design and Build skills.

## The maintenance pass

Run all five jobs for a full pass, or just the one the user asked for. Other framework skills invoke this skill from their closing step for the same pass — see **Best-effort rule** below.

### 1. Lint

Read every node against the workspace's `registry/SCHEMA.md` and the rule list in `references/registry-bundle.md` (§6) — that file is the single source; do not duplicate its rule list here. Report findings in plain language, named by file. **Offer fixes; never silently repair meaning** — a lint pass corrects mechanical issues (formatting, missing index entries) only with the user's confirmation, and never reinterprets or rewrites a node's content on its own judgment.

### 2. Refresh indexes

Regenerate the typed-directory `index.md` files and the bundle-root inventories (Skills and Agents, each with a "used by" column derived from which Workflow nodes link them).

**Quick Start Prompts** are retained from the prior version of this skill. A Quick Start Prompt is a single copy-paste-ready prompt demonstrating an asset's primary use case. When an asset has no `quick_start_prompt` frontmatter field, generate one and **offer to write it back into the asset's frontmatter** (with the user's confirmation — this is the only write this skill makes outside the bundle and its derived views). Until it's written back, show the generated prompt in the index but note it's unsaved.

**Guidelines:**
- One sentence that triggers the asset's main workflow
- Specific enough to be immediately useful
- Generic enough to work across different contexts
- Should produce a complete result, not just start a conversation

**Examples:**

| Type | Name | Quick Start Prompt |
|------|------|--------------------|
| Skill | reviewing-student-goals | "Review student learning goals from my course platform, update each student's record, and give me a cohort theme analysis." |
| Skill | writing-linkedin-posts | "Write a LinkedIn post about [topic] using my brand voice." |
| Agent | playbook-question-answerer | "Answer the question 'What are the six AI building blocks?' using the Hands-on AI site content." |
| Agent | hbr-editor | "Review this article for HBR publication quality and give me prescriptive feedback." |
| Prompt | meeting-prep-quick | "Prepare me for my meeting with [name] at [company] tomorrow." |

Context files typically don't need a Quick Start Prompt — use `—`. If unsure, ask the user rather than guessing.

### 3. Regenerate GENERATED blocks

Rewrite the content between `<!-- GENERATED:<name> -->` and `<!-- /GENERATED -->` markers: a Workflow node's `# Insights` block, and a Function node's `# Owns` block. Write only inside the markers, never outside them, and never leave a marker pair unterminated.

### 4. Regenerate dashboards

**Tier 1 — `REGISTRY.md` (always, on every pass).** Structure, fixed by the reference example:

- Business header (name, linked if a URL is set)
- One section per line of business, in curated order
- Within each, one subsection per process, each holding a workflow table in value-chain order with status, execution mode, autonomy, and review-by date
- A **Review dates** section, sorted ascending
- An **Unassigned** section for anything the bundle can't place
- A **Skills** inventory and an **Agents** inventory, each with description and "used by"

No Health, Last Run, or Step columns — framework step is inferred from artifact presence (`references/registry-bundle.md` §4), not stored. No generation-date line — the file's content is the only thing that changes, so a timestamp footer would just create diff noise.

**Tier 2 — `registry-dashboard.html` (on request: "generate my dashboard").** Read the bundle, build a data island matching `references/data-island.schema.json`, and inject it as the **only** change into `references/dashboard-template.html`'s `<script type="application/json" id="data">` element — never touch the renderer around it. Save the result as `registry-dashboard.html` at the workspace root.

*Claude platforms:* after generating `registry-dashboard.html`, offer to publish it as an Artifact.

### 5. Append `log.md`

Record schema changes and migrations only — not routine content edits. Routine node writes don't need a log entry.

## Refusal + self-healing rule

Refuses to regenerate derived views while lint reports errors — with the reference's self-healing exception: broken-link errors that point at derived content the pass is about to rewrite (stale links left in GENERATED views by renames/retirements) do not block emission; a post-emit lint is the backstop. Without this exception, a rename deadlocks the composer on the very files whose regeneration would clear the error.

## Workspace-generator precedence

If the workspace contains `tools/compose-registry.js`, run `node tools/lint-registry.js && node tools/compose-registry.js` instead of assembling the dashboards by hand — the workspace's own generator is authoritative.

## Best-effort rule

A failed refresh must never fail the step that requested it. If the environment can't write to the workspace root, print the regenerated dashboard with its location for the student to save, say so, and continue.
