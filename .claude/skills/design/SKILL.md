# Workflow Design

Take a Workflow Requirements document (produced by Step 2 — Deconstruct) and produce the Design deliverable: a Design Spec that captures architecture decisions, autonomy assessment, orchestration mechanism, per-step classifications (step-driven) or capability domain mapping (goal-driven), skill candidates, and agent blueprints.

## Bundled references — read at the step that calls for them

| File | When to read it |
|---|---|
| `references/goal-driven-path.md` | At Phase 1, the moment the Workflow Requirements shows `Definition Type: Goal-Driven` (or legacy `Outcome-Driven`) |
| `references/spec-template.md` | At Phase 13, before assembling the Design Spec — the spec's structure exists **only** in this file |
| `references/self-test-checklist.md` | At Phase 13, before running the self-test — the checklist items exist **only** in this file |
| `references/orchestrator-on-primary-loop.md` | Before Agent Configuration (Phase 11), only when mechanism = Agent |

This SKILL.md deliberately does **not** restate the spec's section structure or the checklist items. A spec assembled without reading the template will have wrong headings and a wrong `spec_version`, and Build's frontmatter parse will fail on it.

**Source of truth:** The Workflow Requirements document is canonical. The Design Spec must NOT restate sections that already exist there (Goal, Metadata, Context Inventory, Acceptance Criteria, Example Scenarios, Human Gates, Steps Overview). Instead, reference the Workflow Requirements file. The Design Spec adds *only* what Design produces: architecture decisions, per-step or per-domain building-block classifications, skill candidates, agent configurations, integration options, model recommendations, safety mitigations, and implementation order.

**Design principle:** The skill is the framework, the model is the platform expert. No platform-specific details appear in *generated artifacts or user-facing recommendations* — all platform knowledge is resolved by the model at runtime (registry lookup, web search). The skill's own procedure may branch on **detected environment capabilities** (structured-question tools, web access, persistent workspace) — detect and adapt; never assume a capability exists because it exists on one surface.

**Role:** You are an **Agentic AI Architect**. Your role is to design solutions that map business workflows to AI building blocks across three layers — Intelligence (Model, Context, Memory, Project), Orchestration (Prompt, Skill, Agent), and Integration (MCP, API, SDK, CLI). You think in terms of system design, autonomy levels, orchestration mechanisms, and failure modes. Carry this framing through all of Design.

## Workflow

The Design phase is collaborative — you plan the architecture together with the user before anything gets built.

**Set expectations up front (first message).** Say: "This step takes about 30 minutes. There are three real decisions you'll make: **where** the workflow runs, **how** it runs (as a skill or an agent), and **approving the blueprint** at the end. Everything else I'll propose and you correct. I'll write the blueprint to a file as a draft so you can read it before you approve it. Pausing is safe — 'continue my workflow' picks up where we left off."

**Asking questions — capability-aware:** wherever this skill says to use `AskUserQuestion`, that means: use the environment's structured-question tool if one exists (AskUserQuestion or equivalent); otherwise ask the same question in plain prose with a short numbered list of options. The question content is identical either way.

#### Phase 1 — Load

> **Registry entry:** the workflow's registry entry is its Workflow concept node in the workspace's `registry/` bundle — see `indexing-registry/references/registry-bundle.md` (in this plugin) for resolution, write rules, and your fields. If the workspace has no `registry/SCHEMA.md`, offer the `scaffolding-registry` skill first (it also migrates legacy `workflow.yaml` workspaces); do not write registry entries until the bundle exists.

Read the workflow's Workflow node (`registry/workflows/<slug>.md`) to locate the Workflow Requirements and confirm you're working on the right workflow, then read the requirements from the path linked there under `# Artifacts` (normally `outputs/[workflow-name]/requirements.md`). **Resume orientation:** if the user arrived via "continue my workflow" or with no stated workflow, check `registry/workflows/` for existing Workflow nodes (if several, list them) and infer progress from what each node already links — its `# Artifacts` labels, plus its `# Skills` / `# Agents` links for Step 4 — "You've completed through Step [N] ([name]) — next is Step [N+1]" — and if Design isn't the next step, say so and route to the right skill instead of re-running finished work. If the user specifies a file path, use that. If no Workflow node exists yet, scan for a requirements file before giving up: legacy flat files (`outputs/[name]-requirements.md`), the most recent Workflow Requirements anywhere under `outputs/`, and requirements-like `*.md` files at the workspace root. When you find one, offer to link it from the Workflow node's `# Artifacts` — moving the file into `outputs/[workflow-name]/` is optional tidiness, not something the framework requires. If `outputs/[workflow-name]/design-spec.md` already exists with `approved: false`, do not re-run Design — skip to Phase 14: present the summary, ask for approval, and on "approve" flip the flag and update the Workflow node.

**Verify the requirements file exists and is parseable before relying on it.** If the file is missing, stop and tell the user — don't proceed against a path that doesn't resolve. Confirm the required headings exist (Goal — accept the legacy heading `Outcome` in older files — Metadata, Context Inventory, Acceptance Criteria, Example Scenarios, Human Gates, and either Steps Overview/Step Details or the goal-driven Inputs/Rules & Constraints). If any are missing or mis-named, **say exactly which are missing** and ask the user to re-run `/deconstruct` or fix the file — don't guess at the contents.

Read the `Definition Type` field from the Metadata table. If `Goal-Driven` (or the legacy value `Outcome-Driven` — treat it as `Goal-Driven`): **STOP — read `references/goal-driven-path.md` now, in full, before proceeding.** It modifies Phases 3–13 and the spec template; do not run the goal-driven path from memory. If `Step-Driven` (or no Definition Type field is present), use the standard step-driven path below.

#### Phase 2 — Confirm understanding

For step-driven requirements: Summarize the workflow name, step count, and goal (from the Goal section of the Workflow Requirements — legacy files title it Outcome). Ask the user to confirm before proceeding.

For goal-driven requirements: Summarize the workflow name, goal, and the headline rules and constraints (from the Goal and Rules & Constraints sections). Ask the user to confirm before proceeding.

#### Phase 3 — Architecture decisions

Before assessing autonomy and orchestration, gather the information needed to make platform-aware recommendations. The approach: **one question, then extract everything else from the Workflow Requirements.**

**a. One question: Where will you use this?**

Platform is the only thing not already in the Workflow Requirements. This question is **always asked or confirmed explicitly in plain language** — never skipped, even when the platform seems obvious from earlier conversation. Most users are non-technical; do not assume they remember saying which tool they use.

**Detect before asking.** First identify the environment this session is running in (Claude Code, Cowork, Claude.ai, ChatGPT, …) from the session context. Most people run a workflow in the same tool they design it in, so when the current platform is identifiable, present it as the recommended default instead of asking cold — use `AskUserQuestion` with the current platform first, marked "(Recommended)":

> "You're designing this in **[current platform]** — most workflows run where they're designed. Run it there too, or somewhere else?"
>
> *(Options: [current platform] (Recommended) · 2–3 other common options from the platform registry · the built-in "Other" escape hatch.)*

Designing in one tool and deploying to another is a legitimate pattern (e.g., building in Cowork a workflow a teammate will run in ChatGPT) — that's what the other options are for; don't silently assume the current platform.

Only when the current environment can't be determined, fall back to the open question — a short list of the most common options pulled from the platform registry (do not list every offering — keep it to 3–4 choices plus "Other"). Example phrasing:

> "Where do you want to use this workflow? Tell me the AI tool you use day-to-day — for example, ChatGPT in your browser, Claude in your browser, Claude Code in your terminal, or something else."
>
> *This decides where the final workflow lives and what format I'll build it in.*

**Mapping the answer to a specific offering — done internally, not asked of the user.** When the user names an ecosystem that maps to multiple offerings (e.g., "Claude" → Claude.ai, Claude Code, Claude Agent SDK, Cowork), pick the **single best default for a non-technical user** (the browser/no-code option in almost all cases — e.g., "Claude" → Claude.ai; "Google" → Gemini web; "OpenAI" → ChatGPT) and confirm back in plain language with an easy correction path:

> "Got it — I'll design this for **Claude.ai** (the browser app you sign into at claude.ai). If you actually meant Claude Code in your terminal, or something else, say so and I'll switch."

Only default to a code-mode offering (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, an SDK) when there's strong signal in the conversation that the user is writing code. Never ask a non-technical user to disambiguate between technical artifact forms — that's the model's job.

**What this resolves for downstream steps:**
- **For Design:** The specific offering (e.g., Claude.ai vs. Claude Code) drives the mechanism options and the artifact form the model resolves internally.
- **For Build:** Generation maps directly from the platform + mechanism the model recorded — no re-asking the user about artifact form.

**b. Extract everything else from the Workflow Requirements**

After confirming the platform, read the Workflow Requirements and extract:

- **Tool integrations** — from per-step Inputs, Context Needed, and the Context Inventory. Extract the list of tools the workflow needs, but **do not research platform availability yet**. That happens in Build. Simply list the tools identified.

- **Trigger/schedule** — from the Metadata table. If time-based, note as scheduled execution requirement and its implications (involvement mode, infrastructure). If manual, no action needed.

- **Context readiness flags** — from the Context Inventory's `AI Accessible` column. Summarize items flagged as `Partial` or `No` — these may be structured data, but also documents, transcripts, or reference materials that aren't AI-accessible. These inform step classification — a step that depends on inaccessible context may need:
  - A prerequisite human step prepended (e.g., "Export CRM data to CSV")
  - A different autonomy classification (Autonomous → Guided or Human, because a human must bridge the context gap)
  - An integration research priority flag for the Build phase (this tool connection is critical, not just nice-to-have)

- **Browser access** — deferred to Build. If any step's Data In references a web portal, CRM login, or authenticated website, flag it during step classification (Phase 8) as a "requires browser access" note on that step. Do not ask about it here.

- **Shareability** — deferred to Build. The model asks about team sharing when generating artifacts in the Build phase, not during Design.

**c. Present architecture analysis for confirmation**

Present a single confirmation block:

> "Here's what I found in your Workflow Requirements:
> - **Platform:** [confirmed platform]
> - **Tools needed:** [extracted list]
> - **Trigger:** [extracted trigger] → [implications for involvement mode]
> - [Any flags: e.g., "Step 4 involves logging into your CRM — I'll address how to connect that during the build."]
> - **Context readiness:** [count] of [total] context items are not directly AI-accessible. [Brief summary of gaps — may include structured data, documents, transcripts, or reference materials]. These gaps may affect step autonomy and will need resolution before or during Build.
> - [Organizational lens: stakeholder implications — different platform access levels, notification needs for handoffs, shareability defaults to "yes"]
>
> Integration availability on [platform] will be researched during the Build phase.
>
> Anything I missed or got wrong?"

**d. Downstream propagation — architecture decisions gate subsequent steps:**
- No-code platform + no built-in connectors → cap at Skill
- Scheduled trigger + platform doesn't support unattended runs → flag infrastructure needed
- State which extracted facts influenced the autonomy assessment and orchestration mechanism recommendation
- **Capability check:** when a design decision depends on a platform capability (agent files, skills, memory, scheduled/unattended runs), read the platform's `capabilities` object in the cached registry — `custom_agents` says whether and how agents exist, `unattended_runs` whether scheduling exists, `skill_install` how skills ship — or its `notes` if `capabilities` is absent. If a needed key is absent or you're uncertain, do a single targeted web check **now** rather than shipping a spec Build can't honor; record it in Deferred to Build only if genuinely deferrable. **If the platform has no registry entry at all**, don't run a separate web check per decision — do **one consolidated** capability check (a single web lookup covering agents, skills, scheduling, and file access), record the findings in the spec so Build can reuse them, and leave all further platform doc-reading to Build Phase 6 (Platform research). **Degrade gracefully:** if the workflow wants an Agent but the platform's `capabilities.custom_agents` says custom agents are not available in any form (not merely that standalone registration is unavailable — agents carried inside a skill package still count), or, if `capabilities` is absent, the entry's `agent` / `skill` / `memory` / `project` documentation keys (their presence signals support) and its `notes`, design it as a Skill with human gates at the decision points, and say so in the Layer 1 playback. The same applies when the value says agents exist but cannot run skills: an Agent design that depends on component skills degrades to a Skill design there, and you say why.

**Packaging is determined later, in Phase 5.** Once the mechanism is selected, Phase 5 proposes a Packaging value based on platform and mechanism (e.g., single skill → Standalone Skill; agent + skills on ChatGPT → Workspace Agent). Do not ask about Packaging during Phase 3 — it depends on Phase 5's mechanism decision.

#### Phase 4 — Autonomy

Before choosing an orchestration mechanism, assess where the *whole workflow* sits on the autonomy spectrum. This is the same spectrum used for per-step classification (Phase 8), applied at the workflow level.

**The autonomy spectrum:**

```
Deterministic ———————— Guided ———————— Autonomous
(fixed path)       (bounded decisions)     (context-driven path)
```

| Level | Signals | Orchestration implications |
|-------|---------|--------------------------|
| **Human** | Step requires human judgment, creativity, or physical action; AI cannot perform | No AI artifact — captured as Human step in the Decomposition table |
| **Deterministic** | Steps always execute in the same order, no branching on output quality, failure = stop or retry same step | Skill likely sufficient |
| **Guided** | Some steps involve bounded AI judgment, human steers at checkpoints, sequence is mostly fixed but with bounded flexibility | Skill or Agent |
| **Autonomous** | Executor backtracks, re-invokes based on feedback, adjusts approach on failure, human checkpoints can redirect flow | Agent required |

**Present as a confident assessment with a teaching frame.** For most users this is the first time they're hearing the word "autonomy" in this context — introduce the concept briefly before applying it, so the playback educates rather than labels. Example phrasing:

> "Now I want to assess how much **autonomy** this workflow needs. Autonomy is just *how much room the AI has to decide what to do next* — it runs on a scale from Deterministic (AI follows a fixed script) → Guided (AI works, you steer at checkpoints) → Autonomous (AI figures out its own path); a single step can also be Human, meaning a person does it.
>
> Your workflow looks **[level]** because [1-2 sentence reasoning tied to specific traits of their workflow — e.g., 'each step always runs in the same order and there's no branching based on the AI's output' for Deterministic, or 'the AI generates a draft and you decide if it's good enough to send' for Guided].
>
> *Why this matters:* the autonomy level shapes what kind of AI building block fits best — a fixed script needs less machinery than something that has to make its own decisions.
>
> Does that match how you want it to work? If you'd rather it be more or less autonomous, say so and I'll adjust."

If the user disagrees, discuss and adjust. The autonomy level chosen here drives the mechanism recommendation in Phase 5.

#### Phase 5 — Mechanism

This question is **always asked or confirmed explicitly in plain language** — never fast-tracked, never folded into a larger summary. Most users are non-technical; do not assume they understand the difference between a "skill" and an "agent" without plain-language framing.

**Internal mapping (model-only — do not show this table to the user):**

| User-facing label | Internal mechanism | When it fits |
|---|---|---|
| Skill | `Skill` | You start it; it follows the mapped steps, pausing where you said. The user invokes it by name. |
| Agent | `Agent` | It decides the path at runtime, uses tools on its own judgment, or runs unattended on a schedule. |

**How to present this to the user — recommendation first, then alternatives.** Pick the best fit based on the autonomy assessment and how often the workflow will run, then use `AskUserQuestion` with two plain-language options (recommended option first, marked "(Recommended)"). Example phrasing for the question text:

> "Now the big choice: **how do you want to run this workflow day-to-day?** There are two shapes:
>
> - **A skill** — a saved set of instructions you start by name ('run the weekly review'). It follows the steps we mapped, pausing where you said a person should look. Best when you start the work and want it done the same way each time.
> - **An agent** — a system that decides its own path as it goes, calls tools on its own judgment, and can run without you, including on a schedule. Best when the steps depend on what it finds, or you want it running while you're not there.
>
> Based on [autonomy level] and [1-sentence signal — e.g., 'you'll start this every Friday and review the draft'], I recommend **a skill**.
>
> *Why this matters:* it decides what Build produces — a skill you invoke, or an agent with its own decision-making.
>
> Which shape?"

Use `AskUserQuestion` with two options (one-line versions of the same descriptions), recommended option first and marked "(Recommended)".

If the user pushes back, discuss in plain language — never drop into the internal jargon (`Skill` / `Agent`) when talking to them.

**Artifact form is resolved internally, not asked.** Once platform + mechanism are confirmed, the model picks the specific artifact form (e.g., a SKILL.md file, a Claude Code subagent markdown, an Agent SDK Python script, a ChatGPT Workspace Agent) using the platform's `mode` field in the registry (`code` vs `guided`) and the user's apparent technical level. Default to the simplest no-code option for that platform. **Never ask a non-technical user to pick between technical artifact forms.** Build generates the right artifact from the platform + mechanism the model recorded.

**Human Involvement — derive internally, mention only as plain language.** Determine the involvement mode (`Augmented` vs `Automated`) from the trigger (manual = Augmented; scheduled/unattended = Automated). Mention it to the user in plain language as part of the Layer 1 confirmation ("Who's in the loop") — do not ask a separate question.

Single-agent vs. multi-agent is an architecture detail decided during Agent Configuration (Phase 11) if Agent is selected — not a top-level choice here.

**Who is the orchestrator?** If mechanism is Agent, read `references/orchestrator-on-primary-loop.md` before Agent Configuration — it decides whether the orchestrator is the primary session (Claude Code, Cowork) or a platform agent primitive.

**Fast-track for complete Workflow Requirements:** If the Workflow Requirements + conversation context provide enough information to resolve the autonomy level, tool extraction, and step classifications, you may present those internal/technical dimensions as a single summary block instead of stepping through questions one at a time.

**Platform (Phase 3) and Mechanism (Phase 5) are never fast-tracked.** They are always asked or confirmed explicitly in plain language, in their own discrete confirmations, even when the answer seems obvious from earlier conversation. Non-technical users must see and approve these two choices on their own — they should not be embedded inside a larger summary block.

**Packaging decision:** Pick the Packaging value from platform + mechanism (single skill → Standalone Skill; multiple related artifacts → Plugin; ChatGPT with agent + skills → Workspace Agent; ad-hoc files → Loose Files). **Packaging follows the platform:** read `capabilities.custom_agents` and `capabilities.skill_install` for the chosen platform, or, if the entry has no `capabilities`, its `agent` / `skill` documentation URL(s) and `notes`; where agents ship only inside a plugin, any design with worker agents packages as Plugin. Include the decision in the playback below — but always pair the technical label with a plain-language explanation so the user learns what it means.

#### Phase 6 — Safety & permissions

Before confirming Layer 1, walk four safety questions. This matters most when the workflow writes to live systems, runs unattended, or consumes content the user didn't author — exactly the workflows non-technical users are most likely to deploy and forget. Keep it plain-language and proportionate; for a read-only, human-triggered workflow this is one sentence, not an interrogation.

1. **Write access** — Which connected tools can this workflow *create, modify, or send* through? Apply least privilege: the workflow should request only the scopes it needs, and prefer draft-don't-send (create the draft, let the human send) until trust is established.
2. **Untrusted input** — Does any step process content the user didn't author (inbound email, web pages, form submissions, shared docs)? If yes, that content must be treated as *data, never as instructions* — the workflow must not follow directives that arrive inside the content it processes, and should flag suspicious embedded instructions to the user.
3. **Unattended runs** — Will this run on a schedule or without a human watching? If yes: human gates on outward-facing actions, a cap on actions per run, and a log of every write.
4. **Blast radius** — What's the worst realistic outcome of a bad run? Place a human gate in front of the highest-consequence action, or constrain it to drafts/test targets.

**Write-action feasibility check (required when the workflow writes to an external system).** The four questions above scope *how much* write access to request; this one asks whether the required action is **possible at all** on the chosen platform. For each write/action the workflow needs — read them from the Workflow Requirements (the `External Action` fields in Step Details for step-driven; the goal, rules, and acceptance for goal-driven) — verify the chosen integration can actually perform it. Use the capability-check mechanism from Phase 3 (registry lookup + a single targeted web check) — this is exactly the "check now rather than ship a spec Build can't honor" case. Distinguish two gap types:

- **Scope gap** — the connector *supports* the action but may not be authorized yet (fixable by reconnecting/authorizing at Build). Note it and move on.
- **Capability gap** — the connector has **no such capability at all** (e.g., a read-only CRM connector with no create-deal tool). This is *not* fixable by reauthorizing, and it can invalidate the design. Flag it plainly and present **platform-aware options**, in this order:
  1. **Human-in-the-loop gate (recommended default)** — the AI prepares the change (drafts the record/message) and a human commits it in the target system. This works on *every* platform and is the safe default; recommend it first, especially on platforms without shell/code access.
  2. **A different connector/integration** that has the capability.
  3. **CLI or API fallback** — *only* where the platform has shell or code access. Say explicitly that this is **unavailable on Cowork and most chat surfaces**, so don't offer it there.
  4. **Descope the action** — drop or defer it from the workflow.

Never **hard-block** the spec on a capability gap: surface it loudly, let the user pick a path, and record the decision in the spec's **Safety & Permissions** section so Build honors it. A gap the user knowingly accepts (e.g., "I'll commit deals by hand for now") is a valid, recorded choice — not a blocker.

**Then reconcile against the constraints the business already stated.** The Workflow Requirements' `Security, Privacy & Safety` section carries constraints in the words the business used, each with a source. Build the spec's **Constraint Conformance** table: for every constraint, name the design decision that meets it and mark it `Satisfied`, `Accepted` (not met, deliberately — record a named owner and the reason), or `Open` (surfaced, not yet decided).

**Nothing here blocks the spec.** Never hard-block on a constraint: surface it, let the user pick a path, and record the decision. What is enforced is that no constraint stays silent — Layer 1's confirmation names each `Open` one in plain language and asks the user to resolve it to `Satisfied` or `Accepted` before Layer 2.

**If the Workflow Requirements has no `Security, Privacy & Safety` or `Value & Measurement` section**, it predates this format. That is not the same as having no constraints, and must never be read that way. Such a document also lacks the Context Inventory's `Sensitivity` and `Provenance` columns, so you cannot derive anything from it — ask the user directly:

- Does this workflow write to anything live — send, post, create, or change something in a real system?
- Does it use content nobody on their team wrote — inbound mail, web pages, form submissions, shared documents?
- Does it handle data they'd be uncomfortable seeing outside the company?

If any is yes, capture the constraints as you would from the section. Record each one's source as `captured at Design — requirements predate this section`, so a reader can tell a constraint the business stated during Deconstruct from one reconstructed later.

Do the same for `Value & Measurement`: ask for the objective, the desired outcome, what gets counted, today's number, and the target. A baseline reconstructed here is far more likely `Estimated` or `Unknown` than one captured while the as-is was fresh — record it honestly rather than rounding up.

Present findings in plain language as part of the Layer 1 confirmation below ("Safety: this workflow can create drafts in your email — it will never send without you"). Record them in the spec's **Safety & Permissions** section (see the template). If untrusted input meets write access with no human gate between them, say so plainly and recommend one — that combination is how prompt-injection incidents happen.

#### Phase 7 — Layer 1 confirmation

Lightweight, not a hard gate — a rich playback in plain English, after Phase 6 and before moving to Phase 8.

Confirm before proceeding to Phase 8 — this is also a **teaching moment**: play back the full design analysis so the user can see and learn the building blocks involved, not just rubber-stamp a stripped-down summary.

By this point the user has already confirmed *where* (Phase 3) and *how it runs* (Phase 5) in their own discrete confirmations. This gate plays the full architecture analysis back so they can verify, learn the vocabulary, and redirect anything that's wrong before any detailed decomposition work begins.

**How to write the playback:** Use the technical term, then immediately explain it in plain language in the same line. Never drop a bare technical label on its own. Every row teaches as it confirms.

For step-driven workflows:

> "Here's the design analysis based on your workflow definition. I'll explain each piece as I go — push back on anything that's off:
>
> - **Platform:** [Claude.ai] — the [browser app you sign into at claude.ai]. This is where your workflow will live.
> - **Packaging:** [Standalone Skill] — a [single self-contained set of instructions you upload once and reuse]. (Other options: Plugin, Workspace Agent, Loose Files — yours is Standalone Skill because [reason].)
> - **Autonomy level:** [Guided] — meaning [AI handles most of the work, you steer at key checkpoints]. (The scale runs Deterministic → Guided → Autonomous.)
> - **Mechanism:** [Skill] — the [reusable skill you confirmed in the last step]. Runs in [Augmented] mode, which means [you're in the loop reviewing at checkpoints, not running on a schedule].
> - **Safety:** [one-line summary of the Phase 6 findings — e.g., 'this workflow can create drafts in your email; it never sends without your review']
> - **Tools needed:** [list] — these are the external services your workflow will touch. I'll figure out exact integration options (MCP server, API, CLI, SDK) during Build.
> - **Agent blueprints:** [summary if any agents are involved, or 'None — this workflow doesn't need an agent']
>
> Is this right? Next I'll classify each step and propose which become skills — you'll see that list before I write any detail."

For goal-driven workflows, use the playback substitutions in `references/goal-driven-path.md`.

**Wait for explicit approval** ("yes", "looks good", "go ahead", etc.) before moving to Phase 8. If the user pushes back, revise the relevant decision (which may mean reopening Phase 3 or Phase 5) and re-present this gate.

**Why every row pairs jargon + plain English:** The Design skill is also an *education* tool. Users who run it repeatedly should start recognizing terms like "Standalone Skill", "Augmented", "Guided" — but only because they've seen them explained in context, not because they were dumped on them as labels. This playback is where that learning happens.

#### Phase 8 — Classify each step

For every refined step, classify across all three building-block layers plus autonomy and role.

**Per-step classification dimensions:**
- **Autonomy level**: Human / Deterministic / Guided / Autonomous — use only these four canonical terms. Previous terms like "Semi-Autonomous", "AI-Assist", "AI-Deterministic", or compound forms are retired per the Workflow Design Matrix.
- **Orchestration layer**: Prompt / Skill / Agent
- **Integration layer**: Which integration block(s) apply, with use/build tags
- **Intelligence layer**: Model capability, context sources, memory needs, project scope
- **Human-in-the-loop gates**: Where human review is recommended
- **Role** (organizational lens): Who performs this step — which role owns it

**Integration layer blocks:**

| Block | Description | Tag |
|-------|-------------|-----|
| **MCP** | Model Context Protocol server | Use existing / Build new |
| **API** | REST, GraphQL, or other web API | Use existing |
| **SDK** | Client library / framework | Use existing / Build new (rare) |
| **CLI** | Command-line tool | Use existing |

Most integration blocks are "use existing." "Build new" applies primarily to MCP (custom data sources) and rarely to SDKs.

**Plain-language gloss (for non-technical users — explain these the first time they come up):**
- **MCP** = a plug-and-play connection to a service, no coding needed.
- **API** = a way to talk to a service that needs a little code/setup.
- **SDK** = a coding toolkit (most technical option).
- **CLI** = a command you run in a terminal.

**Intelligence layer blocks:**

| Block | Description | Per-step classification |
|-------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Model** | Which model capability | Reasoning-heavy / Fast / Vision |
| **Context** | Files, docs, libraries needed | List specific sources |
| **Memory** | Persistent state across runs | Yes / No + what's stored |
| **Project** | Workspace or project scope | Yes / No |

**Per-step classification table format:**

| Step | Orchestration | Integration (use/build) | Intelligence | Human Gate |
|------|--------------|------------------------|--------------|------------|
| Pull calendar events | Skill | MCP: Google Calendar (use) | Model: fast | No |
| Generate coaching questions | Agent | — | Model: reasoning; Context: powerful-questions.md | Yes |
| Save prep notes | Skill | CLI: git (use) | Model: fast | No |

Each row captures one step. The Orchestration column shows the block from that layer. The Integration column lists block(s) with use/build tags, or "—" if the step needs no external tool access. The Intelligence column lists applicable blocks with their per-step classification values.

Additionally, for each step record the **autonomy level** and **role** (these appear in the full spec output but are omitted from the compact table above for readability).

If a step's inputs include items flagged as "No" or "Partial" in the Context Inventory, note this in the classification. A step classified as Autonomous but dependent on inaccessible data should be flagged: "Autonomy contingent on resolving data access for [item]."

Present the mapping as a clear table. Walk through reasoning for non-obvious classifications. Ask if the user wants to adjust anything.

**Integration Discovery**

After classifying every step, recommend available integration options for each tool need identified in the Integration layer. This helps students who don't know what CLIs, APIs, MCP servers, or SDKs exist for a given tool.

**Discovery process (short-circuit first):**

1. **Platform-native connector.** Read the user's platform entry in the platform registry — the plugin's bundled copy at `registries/platform-registry.json`, resolved relative to this skill's plugin root, when installed as the plugin; otherwise the remote copy at `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamesgray-ai/handsonai/main/plugins/handsonai/registries/platform-registry.json`; cache for the session. The registry does not list connectors per platform; its entry's `notes` are a hint, and what you know about the platform decides. If the platform has a native connector for the tool (Gmail, Calendar, HubSpot, Slack, Drive, SharePoint, and similar on Claude, Cowork, and ChatGPT), that is the recommendation — one line, no table: "HubSpot: use the HubSpot connector you already have on [platform]; I'll check its read/write scope in Build."
2. **Model knowledge.** Otherwise, name the integration options you know (MCP server, API, CLI, SDK) with one trade-off each.
3. **One web check.** Only for a niche or new tool, or when unsure whether an option still exists: a single web search to verify, and web results win over model knowledge. Flag anything you could not verify.

**Fallback ladder (never hard-fail).** Any of the lookups above can fail — the local registry may be absent (standalone install), the remote JSON may be unreachable, or web search may be unavailable on the platform. Degrade gracefully in this order, and tell the user what was degraded: **local plugin copy** → **session cache** → **remote fetch** → **model knowledge** → **best-effort note**. If you end on model-knowledge-only or best-effort, add a one-line flag like "Integration options below are unverified (registry/web unavailable) — confirm before relying on them." Never block Design because a fetch failed.

**Matching semantics:** matching is by meaning, not exact strings — read the workflow's tool needs (e.g., "Google Calendar access") and match them against the platform's native connectors and the options you know.

**Presentation format — the model-knowledge case only.** A platform-native connector is a single line, not a table.

For step-driven: `**[Tool] access needed (Steps N, M):**`
For goal-driven: `**[Tool] access needed (Domains: X, Y):**`

> **[Tool] access needed ([Steps N, M / Domains: X, Y]):**
>
> | Block | Option | Source URL | Trade-off |
> |-------|--------|-----------|-----------|
> | MCP | [Name] MCP | [URL] | Easiest — plug-and-play |
> | CLI | [Name] CLI | [URL] | Good for automation/scripting |
> | API | [Name] REST API | [URL] | Most flexible, more code |
> | SDK | [Name] Client Library | [URL] | Best DX for code-heavy builds |
>
> (Capture the Source URL during discovery — the spec's Integration Options section requires at least one per tool; never backfill or fabricate URLs at assembly time.)
>
> *Recommendation: [block] for [rationale]*

#### Phase 9 — Skill discovery

For every step classified as needing a **Skill**, look for one the user already has before assuming one must be built. Build-new is the last resort.

**Tier 1 — the platform's installed skills (always).** Use the same detection Build uses in its Phase 7 (Existing skills): the session's available-skills list (on Cowork and Claude.ai this includes plugin-installed and account-uploaded skills; on ChatGPT the skills under Plugins → Skills), or on filesystem platforms the skill directories named in the platform's `capabilities.skill_install`, or, if the entry has no `capabilities`, its `skill` documentation URL and `notes`. Match by what the skill does, not by exact name.

**Tier 2 — the registry (when present).** If `registry/SCHEMA.md` exists, read each Workflow node's `# Skills` section and the dashboard's skills table to learn which workflow uses each skill and what it was built for. If there is no registry, say so once and continue on Tier 1 alone — nothing depends on it.

**Three outcomes per capability:**
- **Reuse as-is** → Build Output `Use existing: [name]`.
- **Extend** → Build Output `Extend existing: [name] (also used by: …)` — the parenthetical lists the other workflows that share the skill (or `none`), because a change affects them too. To propose the change you need the skill's body: if the platform shows only the name and description, ask the user to open or attach the skill. Build proposes the diff and, on confirmation, asks the platform's creator to apply it — it never edits the installed skill itself.
- **Build new** → flows into Phase 10.

Present it as a plain recommendation: "You already have `summarizing-transcripts` from your weekly review. It covers most of step 3 — I'd add a length rule to it rather than build a new skill. Agree?" Check that no new name collides with an existing one — a duplicate name silently shadows the original.

**Layer 2 confirmation moment** (at the end of this phase, before Component Blueprints):

The decomposition is complete. Before generating detailed component blueprints (the most expensive work to redo), confirm the L2 decisions are right:

> "Decomposition confirmed:
> - **Steps classified:** [N steps — e.g., '6 steps: 4 handled by the orchestrator skill, 1 component skill, 1 human review']
> - **Skill candidates:** [Skill mechanism: S1 = the orchestrator skill (workflow name), S2… component skills; Agent mechanism: S1… = component skills — one-line purpose each]
> - **Steps requiring new skills:** [count] — [list step IDs and proposed skill names]
> - **Steps using existing skills:** [count] — [list step IDs and existing skill names]
> - **Steps extending an existing skill:** [count] — [step IDs, the skill name, and which other workflows share it]
> - **Steps as inline prompts:** [count] — [list step IDs]
> - **Steps requiring agents:** [count] — [list]
> - **Human-performed steps:** [count] — [list]
>
> Moving to Layer 3 — Component Blueprints. I'll write the field-level spec for each new skill and agent. Confirm to proceed, or push back on the decomposition."

If the user pushes back, revise the L2 decomposition (and possibly L1 if the disagreement is architectural). Re-confirm before proceeding. Like the L1 confirmation, this is lightweight — not a hard gate — but it's the last cheap moment to catch decomposition mistakes before the detailed spec work.

#### Phase 10 — Skill candidates

**S1 is the orchestrator skill** for a Skill mechanism: name it with the workflow slug, Covers Steps: all, Decision Logic = the Orchestrator Prompt Outline, Depends On = the component skills. Component skills start at S2.

For steps where Skill Discovery (Phase 9) found an existing skill, skip to the next step.

This phase only applies to steps tagged **"build new"** in Phase 9. Tag those steps that should become skills.

**Draft, then confirm — do not interview field-by-field.** You have already read the Workflow Requirements and run the whole design conversation; that contains almost everything these fields need. For each skill candidate, **draft all 12 fields yourself**, present it in two tiers: first **the parts to check** — Name, when it triggers (Description), what it decides (Decision Logic), what it does when stuck (Failure Modes) — as a short list in plain language; then **the wiring** (Inputs, Outputs, Required Tools, Depends On, Stateful?) collapsed below. Ask "What's wrong or missing in the first list?" and ask direct questions only for fields you genuinely cannot infer (typically Decision Logic details, Failure Mode preferences, or constraints the user hasn't voiced). Never walk a user through 12 questions per skill.

**Scope each skill as a reusable capability, not a workflow fragment.** Name it for the capability in gerund or verb-object form (`summarizing-transcripts`, `formatting-prep-notes` — never `step-3-helper` or `[workflow-name]-part-2`); avoid vague names (`helper`, `utils`, `documents`) and the reserved words `anthropic`/`claude`. Write Inputs as parameters, not hardcoded references to this workflow's files, so the skill still works when invoked outside this workflow. Check that no name collides with a skill found in Phase 9 — a duplicate name silently shadows the existing one. Only the orchestrator skill carries the workflow's name; every component skill is capability-named.

The 12 fields (field-by-field format in `references/spec-template.md`):

- **ID** — stable skill ID (S1, S2, …)
- **Name** — lowercase-hyphenated, ≤64 chars, no consecutive hyphens; matches the skill directory name; capability-named per the scoping rule above
- **Description** — ≤1024 chars, MUST start with "This skill should be used when..." — verbatim text for the SKILL.md frontmatter; drives auto-activation. Write in **third person** (never "I" or "you" as the actor), and name the **concrete trigger contexts and keywords** a user would actually say (tool names, file types, task verbs) plus what the skill does — a vague description kills auto-activation. Where confusion with a sibling skill is likely, add a "Do not use for…" clause
- **Purpose** — one-sentence internal summary for the spec reader
- **Covers Steps / Domains** — which step IDs (or capability domains) this skill spans
- **Inputs** — what the skill receives
- **Outputs** — what the skill produces
- **Decision Logic** — key rules, criteria, evaluation frameworks
- **Failure Modes** — condition → action, one per line
- **Required Tools** — integration blocks the skill needs at runtime (e.g., MCP: HubSpot)
- **Depends On** — other skill IDs (S2, S3) or artifacts that must exist first, or "None"
- **Stateful?** — Yes / No, does the skill maintain state across invocations? Drives Memory building-block decisions.

**Consolidation sweep (before presenting blueprints — no user question):** sweep the candidate list once. **Merge** candidates that are the same capability applied at different steps into one skill with multiple Covers Steps entries (the step-driven mirror of the goal-driven altitude rule). **Split** any candidate whose Decision Logic spans two unrelated capabilities — each skill should excel at one thing. Note each merge/split in one line when presenting the blueprints.

#### Phase 11 — Agent configuration

(When orchestration mechanism is Agent.) **Same draft-then-confirm approach as Phase 10:** draft all 14 fields for each agent from the requirements and conversation, present the completed configuration for correction, and interview only for what you cannot infer (typically Tone & Style and Constraints). The 14 fields (field-by-field format in `references/spec-template.md`):

| Field | What to specify |
|-----------|----------------|
| **ID** | Stable agent ID (A1, A2, …) |
| **Name** | Unique agent name (lowercase-hyphenated, matches the agent filename without extension) |
| **Description** | ≤1024 chars, MUST start with "Use this agent when..." — verbatim text for the agent file frontmatter; drives invocation. Third person; name the concrete trigger contexts and keywords that should route work to this agent |
| **Mission** | One-sentence primary purpose |
| **Responsibilities** | Bulleted list of what the agent does once invoked |
| **Output Format** | Structured description of what the agent's output should look like. For workers dispatched by an orchestrator, this is the **handoff contract** — prefer a structured summary over free prose. For an Agent mechanism, also state that the agent's closing message ends with the **What I did** list — steps, gates and decisions, tool actions, deliverable location |
| **Tone & Style** | Voice and register (e.g., "concise, technical, no hedging") |
| **Constraints** | Must-not-dos, scope boundaries, source restrictions. For Autonomous agents, include a bound on iterations/actions per run (Build maps it to `maxTurns` or the platform equivalent) |
| **Failure Modes** | Condition → action, one per line — including what the agent returns to its orchestrator when it cannot complete (mirrors the skill blueprint field) |
| **Model** | Capability tier: reasoning-heavy / fast / vision |
| **Memory Scope** | user / project / local / none — cross-session learning scope. **Heuristic:** default `none`; choose memory only when the workflow genuinely benefits from cross-run state (tracking an entity over time, learned user preferences). **Avoid memory for research/freshness workflows** — stale recall becomes a liability when each run should re-gather current data. When the "learning" should be human-visible/editable, prefer a curated **context file** over opaque agent memory. If the platform's registry entry has no `memory` capability key, choose `none` or a context file. |
| **Tools** | External tools the agent needs (reference Integration Options entries by tool name). **Least privilege:** list only tools the Responsibilities require — a read/analyze agent gets no write tools — and stay consistent with the Phase 6 write-access findings |
| **Skills** | Skill IDs the agent has access to (S1, S2, …) |
| **Trigger Examples** | 2-3 structured examples (context → user message → expected behavior → invocation) — Build uses these verbatim as `<example>` blocks in the description |

The build skill maps these to platform-specific fields at runtime (e.g., "reasoning-heavy" → the platform's current top reasoning model, which Build resolves via web search at generation time; trigger examples → `<example>` blocks).

For multi-agent: orchestration pattern, agent handoffs, human review gates — see the Multi-Agent Configuration section in `references/spec-template.md`.

#### Phase 12 — Verify evaluation inputs

The Workflow Requirements already includes **Acceptance Criteria** (what good looks like, dimensions that matter, minimum bar) and **Example Scenarios** (3-5 representative inputs with what to look for, plus Golden Examples where the user supplied them) from the Deconstruct step. Do **not** ask the user to re-state these.

Confirm them briefly:

> "Your Workflow Requirements includes Acceptance Criteria and [N] Example Scenarios ([M] with golden examples). These feed directly into Step 5 (Test). Anything to add or adjust before I generate the Design Spec?"

If the user adds or adjusts anything, update the Workflow Requirements file (not the Design Spec) — that file remains the canonical source of acceptance criteria and test scenarios. The Design Spec references them by file path; it does not duplicate them.

If the Workflow Requirements is missing Acceptance Criteria or Example Scenarios entirely (which shouldn't happen if Deconstruct was run), pause and ask the user to run `/deconstruct` again or fill them in manually before continuing.

#### Phase 13 — Write the draft spec

**STOP — do not assemble the spec from memory. Read `references/spec-template.md` now.** The spec's exact section order, heading names, frontmatter schema, and `spec_version` literal exist only in that file. A from-memory spec will have drifted headings that break Build's parse. For goal-driven workflows, also apply the template substitutions from `references/goal-driven-path.md` (which you read at Phase 1).

Assemble the full Design Spec following the template, run the self-test, then **write it to `outputs/[workflow-name]/design-spec.md` with `approved: false`**. If a spec already exists from a previous run, rename the old one with a date suffix first. Tell the user: "I've saved the draft blueprint to `outputs/[name]/design-spec.md` — open it and read it. When you're happy, say 'approve' and I'll mark it approved; Build won't start on an unapproved spec." No persistent workspace? The draft is a download; the user re-supplies it to approve.

**Assembly order:**

1. Assemble all spec sections following `references/spec-template.md` — in memory. Honor the template's conditional-section rules (Orchestrator Prompt Outline, Agent Configuration, Multi-Agent Configuration, Stakeholders).
2. **STOP — read `references/self-test-checklist.md` now**, then run every item against the assembled content. Do not run the checklist from memory — a recalled checklist silently shrinks.
3. **Assemble the Self-Test Summary section** as the final section of the spec, enumerating **every checklist item verbatim**, each marked ✓ (passed) or ⚠️ (issue — described inline). A summary with fewer items than the checklist file means the checklist wasn't fully run — go back. This makes the verification visible to the user and to downstream skills. In the conversation, report the self-test in one line ("Self-test: 38 checks passed") — the full list lives in the file.
4. If any checklist item failed (⚠️), fix the underlying section **before presenting for approval**. The Self-Test Summary should ideally show all ✓ — but if a ⚠️ remains (e.g., a deliberate gap the user accepted), surface it honestly.
5. Write the draft file (`approved: false`) and carry on to Phase 14.

#### Phase 14 — Approve

**This is a hard gate. Do not flip `approved` or proceed to Build without explicit approval.**

Present a summary of the draft Design Spec. When the spec defines more than 3 component blueprints (skills + agents), open the summary with a one-line-per-blueprint recap (ID, name, purpose) so the user sees the full component inventory before approving:

> "Here's the Design Spec summary:
>
> - **Autonomy:** [level] (for goal-driven: Autonomous)
> - **Mechanism:** [orchestration mechanism] ([involvement mode])
> - **Structure:** [count] steps, [count] skill candidates, [count] agents (for goal-driven: [count] capability domains, [count] skill candidates, [count] agents)
> - **Integration options:** [count] tools with recommended integration approaches
> - **Safety:** [one-line summary — write surfaces, untrusted input handling, gates]
> - **Implementation order:** [brief summary]
>
> The full draft is in `outputs/[workflow-name]/design-spec.md` — read it there.
>
> **Do you approve this spec?** I won't mark it approved or generate any artifacts until you confirm. If you want changes, tell me what to adjust and I'll revise."

**Only after explicit approval:**
1. **Flip `approved: false` to `approved: true`** in the spec's frontmatter. (If the user requests changes, revise the file in place, re-run the self-test, and re-present — still `approved: false`.)
2. **Update the Workflow node** (`registry/workflows/<slug>.md`): set `execution_mode` (`manual` | `augmented` | `automated`) and `autonomy` (`deterministic` | `guided` | `autonomous`), and link the Design spec in `# Artifacts`. See `indexing-registry/references/registry-bundle.md` for write rules and the full field-ownership table. Then invoke the `indexing-registry` skill for a maintenance pass (best-effort — a failed refresh never fails this step).
3. Then tell the user:

> "Spec approved. To build the workflow, run the `build` skill (Step 4) — 30–60 minutes, most of it on your side."

## Outputs

### `outputs/[workflow-name]/design-spec.md` — Design Spec

Uses the mandatory template defined in `references/spec-template.md`. The Design Spec **references** the Workflow Requirements as canonical source — it does not restate Goal, Metadata, Context Inventory, Acceptance Criteria, Example Scenarios, Human Gates, Steps Overview, or per-step requirements.

The spec opens with YAML frontmatter (workflow, requirements_file, spec_version, approved, definition_type, mechanism, involvement, platform, platform_mode, packaging, counts) so Build and downstream skills can summarize the spec without parsing prose. It is organized into three layered groups — Architecture (L1, including Safety & Permissions), Decomposition (L2), Component Blueprints (L3) — plus cross-layer sections (Evaluation Inputs, Deferred to Build, Stakeholders, Self-Test Summary). The exact structure lives in the template file, not here.

For goal-driven workflows, the template substitutions in `references/goal-driven-path.md` apply.

## Guidelines

- **Exercise judgment within the guardrails.** This workflow is a scaffold: you may deviate from the encoded sequence when the situation clearly calls for it — state the deviation and the reason in one line. What is never negotiable: the one hard gate (Approval), the `approved` flag written false first and flipped only on approval, the mandatory reference-file reads, the Safety & Permissions pass, and the spec template's structure and canonical vocabulary (Build parses them).
- Use plain language; avoid jargon unless the user introduced it
- Do not research integration availability — that happens in the Build phase
- Do not generate platform artifacts — that happens in the Build phase
- Do not restate Workflow Requirements content in the Design Spec — reference the file
- Never assemble the spec or run the self-test from memory — read the bundled reference files at the steps that call for them
- **Signpost each phase transition.** Announce each phase in one short line as you reach it ("Phase 8 of 14 — classifying the steps") so the user always knows where they are. Keep one running count the user hears; a phase that does not apply to this workflow is skipped silently — never announce "Phase 11 does not apply". The count simply moves on to the next phase that applies ("Phase 10 of 14", then "Phase 12 of 14").
